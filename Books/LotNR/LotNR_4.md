Self-Control/Instinct Traits represent the ability to guide or resist frenzy. High Traits in this category help to fight off berserk rage or hunger.

Courage Traits battle against Rötschreck, the Red Fear. With many Courage Traits, you can withstand the terror of fire or sunlight.

The Virtue Traits that you possess depend on your chosen morality. You always start with one free Trait in *Courage*, and if you have *Conscience* or *Self-Control*, you start with one free Trait in each of those. Characters with *Conviction* or *Instinct* have thrown away their more human drives in favor of vampire ethics, but this effort means that you get no free Traits in the appropriate Virtue (so you must assign at least one of your seven Virtue Traits there). See the quick listing of morality for a summation of the Virtues prized by each Path. More complete descriptions of the Virtues and Virtue Tests appear on p. 108.

#### MORALITY TRAITS

While your Virtue Traits represent your ability to hold off against the Beast, your Morality Traits show how closely you adhere to your chosen codes of ethics. A high rating in your Morality Traits indicates that you set high standards for yourself, but you risk losing ground to the Beast even with relatively trivial violations of your chosen morals. Low Morality Traits indicate that you are close to losing control to the Beast forever.

Your starting Morality Trait total equals the average of your Conscience/Conviction and Self-Control/Instinct Traits, rounded up. Thus, you have a Morality rating from one to five Traits. Your number of Morality Traits determines how well you avoid some of the problems associated with the bestial nature of vampires (such as staying awake during the day, rising from torpor and dealing with mortals), but it also indicates what circumstances call for a test of Virtue.

During character creation, you may choose to lose one Morality Trait in exchange for gaining two Free Traits. You may do so only once — losing a Morality Trait counts as taking two Negative Traits. Be warned though, that doing so is a dangerous course; a low Morality Trait total practically guarantees eventual disintegration into the Wassail, the final frenzy.

#### NEGATIVE TRAITS

Some characters have particular weaknesses or shortcomings. Others just never developed in some fashion, or suffered injuries that set back otherwise strong attri-

butes. Such hindrances are represented with Negative Traits. Though Negative Traits are not required, they can represent a deficiency or injury in your character.

Since few people actually want to play a character with handicaps and problems, Negative Traits grant bonuses in other areas of character creation. Each Negative Trait taken is good for one Free Trait later. You may take up to five Negative Traits, though you should not take more than three Negative Traits in any one attribute category.

Unlike other Attributes, you should only take Negative Traits from the list here. Although there are certainly other adjectives that would appropriately describe a character's drawbacks, nobody can be expected to guess a Trait that isn't covered in the rules.

Remember to take Negative Traits that you can roleplay accurately and well. The Storyteller may force you to "buy off" Negative Traits that you ignore consistently.

A complete listing of Negative Traits, and how they affect play, begins on p. 81.

derangements

In addition to Negative Traits, you can choose derangements for your character. A derangement represents some sort of mental instability or neurotic behavior. Taking a derangement counts as two Negative Traits and thus grants you two Free Traits, but you can only take one derangement at character creation (or one extra, in the case of Malkavians, who all start with one). Be warned, derangements cause unpredictable and uncontrollable behavior at times, and a Storyteller is justified in asking you to "buy off" any derangement that you do not roleplay accurately.

Remember that playing a derangement is an exercise in advanced roleplaying. Insanity is neither humorous nor light. You should always consult your Storyteller before deciding to take a derangement.

Choosing Flaws

Representing specific deficiencies or drawbacks aside from inherent weaknesses common to many people, Flaws showcase particular problems. As with Negative Traits, Flaws grant additional Traits to the user. Each Flaw is rated in terms of its value, ranging from one to seven Traits. The higher the value, the more debilitating the Flaw. A character may total up to seven Traits of Flaws. Elder vampires may have more Flaws; after all, age takes its toll.

Flaws begin on p. 112, with the listings for Merits and Flaws.

Free traits

Because no two Cainites are alike, each character gets an allotment of Free Traits to spend on any area of development desired. If you want your character to be socially adept but also intelligent, for instance, you can use Free Traits to improve your Attributes so that you have a high number of Traits in both categories. You could decide to use Free Traits for extra Backgrounds if your character has strong mortal connections, or for Disciplines if she has studied her vampiric powers especially well.

Each character gets five Free Traits at this stage. Additional Free Traits are earned from Negative Traits, Flaws or Derangements taken earlier, or by removing Morality Traits. One Negative Trait grants a single Free Trait. A derangement or Morality Trait is worth two Bonus Traits, and Flaws have variable values listed individually.

- One Free Trait can be spent to take an additional Attribute Trait.
- One Free Trait allows for an additional Ability Trait.
- A single Free Trait allows you to declare a specialization in one Ability Trait. Remember that each Ability can only have one specialization.
- One Free Trait converts to an additional Background Trait, though subject to normal Storyteller approval.

![](_page_71_Picture_18.jpeg)

![](_page_72_Picture_0.jpeg)

- Negative Physical Traits: *Clumsy*, *Cowardly*, *Decrepit*, *Delicate*, *Docile*, *Flabby*, *Lame*, *Lethargic*, *Puny*, *Sickly*
- Negative Social Traits: *Bestial*, *Callous*, *Condescending*, *Dull*, *Feral*, *NaÔve*, *Obnoxious*, *Repugnant*, *Shy*, *Tactless, Untrustworthy*
- Mental Traits: *Forgetful*, *Gullible*, *Ignorant*, *Impatient*, *Oblivious*, *Predictable*, *Shortsighted*, *Submissive*, *Violent*, *Witless*
- Two Free Traits can be used for an extra Virtue Trait. Raising Virtues in this fashion does affect total Morality Traits.
  - Three Free Traits can be spent for a Morality Trait.
- Three Free Traits allow for an extra Willpower Trait, subject to generational limits.
- Three Free Traits can be used to purchase the Basic level of *any* one Discipline, in the usual progression, subject to Storyteller approval.
  - Merits have a variable Free Trait cost, dependent on the individual Merit. Choosing merits

The antithesis of Flaws, Merits represent special bonuses and capabilities beyond the norm. Each Merit is rated in terms of its Trait value. To take a Merit, you must expend Free Traits equal to the Merit's value. You can take no more than seven Traits of Merits, total (though some older vampires may have more).

Merits start on p. 112, with the Merits and Flaws section.

### step Five: spark oF liFe

Your character is more than a summation of Traits and adjectives. At this stage, take the concepts that you've emphasized and develop a story for your character. Look for explanations to why the character learned certain things, failed in others and developed as she did. Think about the sort of person that you're playing and the motives of the individual.

- Background Think about the mortal life from which your character came. Where and when were you born? How were you raised? What sort of education did you have, if any? Did you have any particularly spectacular successes, failures, romances or businesses?
- Secrets Secrets are one of the major commodities of Cainite society. Do you have any secret regrets? Hopes? Ambitions? Do you know something that you shouldn't?
- Motivations Figure out why your character interacts with other Cainites and deals with vampire society. Do you seek personal gain? Are you hunting someone or running from persecution? Perhaps you want to impress your sire or find a companion. If you have trouble figuring out why your character would show up in the game, ask a Narrator or Storyteller for a couple of possible motives.
- Appearance The Embrace often wreaks changes on the body, whether to imbue it with the grace and beauty of a predator or to twist into some strange visage. How he stands, walks, holds a cigarette or dresses will be one of the things that other characters will remember him by.

#### derangements

Bulimia, Crimson Rage, Fugue, Hysteria, Immortal Terror, Manic-Depression, Megalomania, Multiple Personalities, Obsessive/ Compulsive, Paranoia, Regression, Sanguinary Animism, Schizophrenia

• Quirks — Everybody has distinctive behaviors. Anything from a habit of saying "Great Caine!" to playing with a ponytail — such mannerisms show off your character's uniqueness. A quirk can even be used to distinguish you when in disguise or using Disciplines to possess another body — or you could copy someone else's quirks.

# arChetypes

Each Archetype describes an essential form of personality. Though a character is more than a simple set of drives, an Archetype provides a basic springboard from which the character's motives and behaviors can develop. An archetypal Nature shows the underlying elements making up a personality, while archetypal Demeanor is the face the character shows to the world around him.

In game play, a character's Nature Archetype serves to provide concrete goals and codes of behavior, which means that a character can call for a retest on a Virtue Test automatically if a frenzy would violate the character's Nature. However, if someone discovers your character's Nature, it can be used against you in the same way a Negative Trait might be, forcing you into a challenge.

**Example:** *Ian, a Malkavian with a Fanatic Nature and a fervent hatred of the Sabbat, is leading five other Kindred against a marauding pack. One of the pack brandishes a Molotov cocktail at Ian, who tests for frenzy and fails. However, Ian's player calls for a retest based on Ian's Nature — he's too driven to let some shovelhead punk fresh out of the ground try to scare him with a cheap tactic. The player makes a second test and wins. Ian pauses only for a moment at the sight of the Molotov before launching himself at the startled pack member.*

*Later, Ian is wounded and winded, and the prince asks him to lead another charge. Ian is in no shape to do so, and he refuses. The prince commands him angrily: "I am your prince and too*  Commanding *for you to refuse." The prince then adds, "You're too much of a Fanatic, Ian, to let these rabble run unchecked through the city." The prince's player calls for a Social Challenge, and because he guessed Ian's Nature correctly, Ian's player must advance two Traits. The challenge is made, and Ian loses. Wearily, the Lunatic rises to his feet and prepares for the next assault.*

- Architect You hope to leave a lasting legacy, to build something for the future.
- Autocrat —You want to take charge, since nobody else can do the job right.
- Bon Vivant Only a good time can assuage your otherwise empty existence.
- Bravo Other people only get in your way of doing things, and you do not hesitate to bully them into line.
  - Caregiver You protect and comfort others.
  - Celebrant You find that joy springs from your overriding passion.
  - Child You need others to nurture and help you.
  - Competitor Everything is a contest, and you plan to win.
- Conformist You take the lead and the cues from someone else, letting others handle the responsibility.
- Conniver There's no point to doing it yourself when you can get someone else to put in the effort.
- Curmudgeon —Nothing's perfect, everything sucks and you're going to make sure that everybody knows it.

- Fanatic One cause, one truth, one purpose you serve and proselytize with absolute conviction.
- Gallant Everything you do is geared toward flamboyance and excess, since you need the attentions of those around you.

  - Loner —You just don't belong, either by choice or by nature.
  - Martyr —Everyone benefits when you shoulder the burdens of your ideals.
- Masochist You test yourself through suffering, and find meaning in enduring pain.
- Monster Build your purpose from a malignant drive to showcase evil through your actions.
- Pedagogue Everyone can learn from your example and experiences; you were born to teach others.
  - Penitent You have sinned, and you cannot rest until you atone for it.
- Perfectionist You do everything with wholehearted zeal aimed at immaculate completion. There's no excuse for flawed efforts.
- Rebel Whether from habit or drive, you lash out at the system and try to break it down.
  - Rogue First and foremost, you look out for number one.
  - Survivor Nothing stops you, for your drive to pull through is indomitable.
  - Thrill-Seeker You're always after the next high, by pushing danger to the edge.
- Traditionalist The old ways are the best ways, so you preserve and protect them.
- Trickster Existence is absurd, so you fill it with humor and irreverence to avoid looking too deeply at the pain.
  - Visionary A goal fills your mind, and your dreams bring faith to others.

# morality paths

The Embrace strips a fledgling vampire of all ties to life and humanity. Turned into an animated mockery of life that subsists on the blood of others, the new vampire can only hope to hang onto some memory of mortal morality. The feelings of compassion, the ineffable tie to life, trust and love are all cast aside by a curse that separates the vampire from the rest of humanity. With all human drives and desires twisted into a raging Beast that demands survival at any cost, only a code of morality stands between the Cainite and utter animalistic insanity.

Most vampires, thrust suddenly into undead society, cling to the trappings of their mortal lives. This Humanity guides vampires to control their urges and to hang on to the shadows of their former consciences. Indeed, many vampires, suddenly terrified by the Hunger, hold themselves to higher standards in death than in life. However, as the ages pass, emotions fade and Cainites become jaded, their Humanity flickering like a dying candle. The Humanity of the most ancient of elders hangs only by a thread, and many lose their Humanity entirely, falling into a final grand dance of frenzy and slaughter until they are put down like rabid dogs by their fellow Kindred. As a vampire loses her Humanity, she comes to resemble a pallid, desiccated corpse and is driven more by her vampire habits: sleeping deeply during the day, giving in to the lassitude of age and finding it difficult to interact with mortals as anything other than prey.

![](_page_74_Picture_23.jpeg)

A rare few vampires have the presence of mind to set for themselves moral standards alien to humanity. As long as the Cainite holds to a rigid code of conduct, the Beast can be kept at bay. Such a restructuring of one's lifetime of morals requires incredible will and many years of dedicated study. Over the centuries, vampires have developed several such alternate moralities, called Paths of Enlightenment. These Paths cast aside all that is humane in favor of a specialized code more appropriate to the undead. Needless to say, despite their stabilizing affect, these Paths are sociopathic — indeed, their practitioners are unquestionably divorced from anything resembling mortal thought or belief. A follower of a Path may channel his vampire urges, but such channels cause instinctive fear and revulsion in mortals.

When you create a vampire character, you default to the morality of Humanity. Your Morality Traits can range from zero to five, with zero Traits indicating that the character has fallen completely to the clutches of the Beast (and is thus no longer suitable for play) and five indicating a character with a highly developed sense of morality. With the permission of a Storyteller, you can start with a Path of Enlightenment, but keep in mind that Paths are difficult and demanding to roleplay. To study a Path, your character must have at least three Willpower Traits, and he must have spent several years abandoning Humanity in favor of a new set of morals (with instruction). Paths also sometimes use different Virtues, and you may not start with as many Virtue Traits if you have *Conviction* or *Instinct* (since it takes work to strip away your human virtues in favor of these inhuman ones).

Each Path (including Humanity) has a Hierarchy of Sins. This Hierarchy elaborates on what constitutes a moral failing for its particular set of ethics. The higher the rating, the stricter the standards. Everything below that rating is automatically considered a failing if performed. Thus, a rare vampire with a Humanity of 5 doesn't *need* to grapple with his conscience over the notion that killing someone is wrong — he already knows that. He does, however, have qualms about putting himself first too often.

A character with several Morality Traits is distanced from the Beast, but conversely, he must hold himself to high standards of behavior, as shown by the many possible sins. With few Morality Traits, a character risks succumbing to the Beast, but trivial moral concerns are too minor to erode his morals further. The details of Morality Traits and Virtue Tests appear on p. 108-111.

The Paths of Enlightenment in this book are often found among non-aligned vampires, or among a few vampires of any sectarian allegiance. Camarilla vampires usually uphold Humanity, though a rare few elders follow different beliefs. Vampires of the Sabbat have their own inhuman Paths of Enlightenment, which are a subject for another book.

### humanity

The majority of vampires default to Humanity. Even the depraved vampires of the Sabbat and the jaded elders of the Camarilla cling to some vestige of Humanity, though such monsters usually have very few Humanity Traits.

The ethics of Humanity uphold what constitutes humane behavior: Humanity warns against stealing, killing, harming others or behaving selfishly.

Humanity Five — Kindred with a score this high can be, ironically, more human than other humans. Many fledgling vampires cling to their moral codes more strictly as a reaction against the new predator roiling in them. Though not necessarily treacly sweet or passive, these Kindred have excruciatingly high standards for themselves and often hold clearly defined concepts of right and wrong.

Humanity Four — Theft is wrong. Murder or harming others is wrong. But sometimes the speed limit is just too damn slow. Vampires at this level are approximate to "normal" social morals, and are on par with most of mortal society. The vampire is concerned with the natural rights of others, but there's some natural selfishness mixed in.

Humanity Three — People die. Stuff breaks. This vampire has little difficulty with the fact that she is a predator. While she won't always go out of her way to vandalize or kill, she accepts that sometimes fate has it in for some people. She does what needs doing with little griping or effort on her part to avoid it. Something of the vampire's inner monster starts to shine through at this stage, causing mortals to feel uncomfortable around her or manifesting some physical eeriness.

Humanity Two — Hey, some people ought to die. Killing is very acceptable to this Kindred, provided the victim deserves to die (and only the vampire knows who's deserving). Theft, injury, torture and destruction are tools to be used to accomplish one's goals, and one's goals are always paramount. Such a state reflects many vampire elders. The vampire begins to acquire a corpselike aspect, and may find it difficult to interact with mortals (who often find him more than a little disturbing).

Humanity One —The lives and property of others mean nothing to a Kindred this far gone. Such a vampire more than likely indulges in twisted pleasures, which can be all manner of atrocity. Perversion, cold-blooded murder, mutilation, wickedness for its own sake are all signs of a Kindred who has not long to continue. The next frenzy may well be the last. Such a vampire may be physically mistaken for human, but only under certain conditions (such as dim lighting and plenty of distractions).

### the path oF Blood

Studied by the Assamites, this Path espouses a connection to Haqim, founder of the clan, through the power of blood. Vampires on this Path hunt down other Cainites, drinking their blood in order to improve their own potency. Those few who evidence distaste for their condition or hatred for the "Get of Khayyin" (descendants of Caine) may be offered the opportunity to convert, to serve the will of Haqim in his

battle against Khayyin's evil childer. By diablerizing their enemies and holding aloof from other Cainites, the students of the Path of Blood seek to overcome the blot of Khayyin's curse and redeem themselves in a transcendence awash in stolen vitae.

The so-called Dervishes hunt for lore and ancient vitae, so that they may understand their enemies and take their power. Even Cainites of weak blood are not immune to the hunts; the Dervishes are said to have ways of mystically preserving the vitae so that other members of their clan can use it. By stealing away the power of other vampires, the Dervishes hope to concentrate it in the hands of the faithful, who purify it through their honor.

Only old and faithful Assamites, and a few converts, study the Path of Blood. Most outsiders and neonates are completely ignorant of this Path. Instruction begins only when the supplicant proves his worth and his desire to be shed of Khayyin's curse in the light of Haqim's glory.

Students of the Path of Blood practice *Conviction* and *Self-Control*.

### the path oF Bones

As walking corpses, vampires truly exist on the cusp of mortality. Death comes to all things sooner or later, so the Gravediggers study the process of physical death, the decay of the body and the extinguishing of the spirit. Practiced largely by Giovanni and some Samedi, these scholarly Cainites strive to unlock the mysteries of death, to understand why death occurs and how vampires cheat the natural cycle. Though they are neither murderers nor cavalier about death, they do occasionally "assist" if death seems to be unnaturally delayed.

Necromantic curiosity drives followers of the Path of Bones to seek out experiments and hidden lore about death. Many consort with ghosts, trying to discern the very motives of the soul. To a Gravedigger, the vampire cheats eternity. The answers to how and why this happens hold the keys to understanding all of mortality, and thus, to all existence. While the Gravediggers may be quite erudite about ghosts and thanatology, many are completely divorced from society, mortal or Cainite.

The Path of Bones upholds *Conviction* and *Self-Control*.

even look remotely human. True Metamorphosists, though, aim not to shock but to evolve. Just as vampires are superior to humans, they claim, there is another state superior to vampirism. By controlling the physical flesh and learning the ways of the body, they hope to cause spirit and mind to follow suit, turning into something beyond vampire.

In keeping with their practices, the Metamorphosists are solitary and cold. Reason, experimentation and self-discipline are the keystones to improvement. Each individual must find the secret keys to her own existence. As such, the students of the Path of Metamorphosis individually chart disparate paths leading to that state above and beyond vampirism.

The Path of Metamorphosis teaches Conviction and Instinct.

#### THE DATH OF NIGHT

Vampires are monsters, claim the Nihilists, and as such, they embody all of the terrible sins of the world. Since vampires serve a place in the greater scheme of existence, the evil of vampirism must be preordained. Thus, instead of simply giving in to the Beast, adherents of the Path of Night seek to spread their evil in cultivated ways, tempting people to damnation and terrifying the faithless. By acting as an agent of evil, the vampire fulfills his role to higher powers.

A vampire on the Path of Night is not a ravening, insane beast. He seeks to show the true depth of evil to others, luring them into vice and highlighting virtue by its opposite. These vampires plague humanity with all manner of terrors and temptations, seeking not only mortal fears but their own escalation as dark angels. By spreading the taint, the vampire hopes to fulfill a preordained destiny, and thus to eventually move on.

The Path of Night teaches Conviction and Instinct.

#### THE DATH OF DARADOX

Espousing riddles that delve into the illusory nature of existence, the Ravnos followers of the Path of Paradox seek to fulfill the demands of karma. By testing others (often with traps or riddles), the Shilmulo determine each person's place in the wheel of ages. Once the veils of the transitory material world are cast aside, the philosopher can lead the subject to his proper place in destiny — even death.

Kindred are believed to be locked outside of maya (the cycle of the universe). While most individuals are reincarnated through samsara, the way of rebirth, vampires have dodged this cycle. Therefore, they have also lost their svadharma, or individual purpose. Thus, it remains to the Shilmulo to determine each vampire's svadharma and get him back on that path, thus advancing maya, by whatever means necessary. If other Kindred fail to understand their svadharma, then it's up to the Ravnos to push them back into samsara. The state of undeath is considered a curse, but Ravnos believe this shruti (what has been learned from the gods) to be due to their failure to understand maya. Only by weaving illusions themselves can they hope to tear away the veils that hide the Ultimate Truths.

The Path of Paradox upholds Conviction and Self-Control.

### the path oF typhon

Set himself is said to lie in wait in the sands of Egypt. His followers, the Setites, work diligently to spread his influence through vice, favors and chains of ecstasy. Using the desires of others for control, the Theophidians gather information about their sleeping god, prepare agents for his return and seek the means to resurrect their deity.

The Corrupters are mistrusted by other Cainites, and with good reason. All Setites keep their motives carefully hidden so that they might draw on the resources of their hapless slaves without hindrance. After all, an ally (unwitting or otherwise) who does not know one's plans cannot effectively counter them. To this end, the Corrupters weave subtle webs of control, holding themselves aloof from petty indulgences while pandering the innermost desires of others. With their religious rites in hidden temples, they offer service and obedience to Set; through their carefully built chains of dependents, they gather the occult secrets and services necessary to strengthen their clan and god.

The Path of Typhon teaches *Conviction* and *Self-Control*.

# attriButes (Bidding traits) The Traits that describe your character's innate capabilities are called At-

tributes. These Attributes are used in the game to perform actions and overcome obstacles. While certain situations may also require Abilities, such matters are a function of training. Even with the appropriate training, you must call on your own strengths to finish the tasks set before you.
