terrors, many Kindred also have Rötschreck triggers related to important personal circumstances. As with frenzy, a Kindred cannot choose to ignore potential Rötschreck triggers just because it wouldn't be expedient to panic.

A vampire who enters Rötschreck flees the object of her fear as directly and rapidly as she can, blindly attacking any obstacles or people that get in her way; if flight proves impossible, the vampire seeks instead to destroy the object of her fear, *then* flee. If for some reason neither fight nor flight is an option, the vampire curls up in abject terror for the duration of the Rötschreck. Note that this fear does not blind the vampire to her self-preservation instincts — a vampire will not leap out a 30-story window to avoid a lit cigarette — but any path that is not obviously suicidal becomes a distinct possibility.

Rötschreck is resisted with a Static Courage Challenge (Courage versus Narrator's difficulty, no Traits risked). Rötschreck is otherwise considered identical to frenzy for the purposes of determining its duration, as well as all challenges and Willpower costs necessary to prevent or end it, with Courage substituted for Self-Control/Instinct wherever applicable. Characters may also be talked out of Rötschreck just like frenzy.

# GOLCONDA

SLAKING THE ENDLESS HUNGER

Some vampires pursue a mystical state of being known as Golconda, where the vampire finally accepts the terms of the Curse. The Camarilla scoffs at the notion of Golconda, calling it a fool's dream, but in the dark of the Final Nights more and more Kindred feel drawn to search out this mystery. The Sabbat and the independent clans consider Golconda beneath notice, a guilt-driven Judeo-Christian fantasy that has no place in such a vicious unlife.

The search is highly personal, and the Storyteller is encouraged to be extremely demanding when it comes to Golconda quests. Bear in mind that Golconda is a goal easily worthy of years of game time and constant progress throughout multiple chronicles. There is only one solid rule for characters on Golconda quests: They must maintain a Humanity rating of at least four Traits and a *Conscience* rating of at least four Traits to remain on the path of Golconda. Slipping below that level will cause mentors to desert a character until he atones for his degeneration. Golconda is not a goal for every character or every player.

Inner peace and transcendent enlightenment aside, characters who manage to achieve Golconda gain several game benefits. A character in Golconda does not expend one Blood Trait per night to awaken, but only one Blood Trait per week. Characters in Golconda also do not frenzy or enter Rötschreck, and supernatural powers that instill such states do not work. Finally, the character may learn all Disciplines equally even if he is not of appropriate generation or clan to learn them. If he ever falls out of Golconda, however, all these benefits disappear immediately.

# TRUE FAITH

True Faith is belief in a power, entity, consciousness — sometimes even a purpose — that is greater than oneself, and as such, it is not limited to any particular religion. Even vampires can have it, but even so, only those beings of the most pure character — only the truly selfless, caring, compassionate and courageous have a chance at possessing True Faith. Most Kindred will only come across True Faith when they do battle with the Inquisition or other hunting groups.

Characters may only improve their Faith with exceptional roleplaying and Storyteller approval. The game uses for True Faith are covered exhaustively in Laws of the Hunt; however, some basic rules for Faith are included here.

• By brandishing his holy symbol, the bearer gains the Social Trait: *Intimidating* when repelling undead and warding off supernatural powers. If used to strike a supernatural creature, a holy symbol grants the extra Physical Traits *Burning* 

![](_page_210_Picture_12.jpeg)

| Courage Difficulties |                                                |  |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|--|
| Traits               | Stimulus                                       |  |
| One                  | Being bullied; lighter; sunrise                |  |
| Two                  | Torch; obscured sunlight                       |  |
| Three                | Bonfire; uncovered window during daylight      |  |
| Four                 | House fire; being burned                       |  |
| Five                 | Trapped in a burning building; direct sunlight |  |

and Searing, and it inflicts one level of aggravated damage. If a vampire has the Flaw: Repelled by Crosses, he takes an additional level of aggravated damage when touched on bare skin by a cross wielded by a person with True Faith.

• A character with True Faith may attempt to repel vampires by brandishing his holy symbol, invoking his belief ("In the name of \_\_\_\_\_\_, I command you to be gone," etc.) and employing a Social Challenge. Success means the vampire must flee the area immediately. Failure means the vampire must still back off a few feet and cower before taking action, and the vampire still may not initiate any attacks during the next turn, although she may defend herself normally. A vampire may only resist this use of Faith by attempting to overbid with Willpower; if she currently possesses at least twice as many Willpower Traits as the Faithful character, she remains unaffected. A character may attempt to repel multiple vampires with a group challenge.

It is much easier to lose Faith than gain it; any time a character fails a test in which True Faith was involved, he has a crisis of faith. During such a time, he is one Trait down on all Social Challenges for the remainder of the scene and unable to invoke his Faith again until that Faith Trait has been restored (Narrator's discretion).

#### BLOOD BOND

Many undead exploit the heady emotions found in drinking vampiric vitae to stir passion in their dead hearts, but it is a dangerous rush, for if a being drinks from the same vampire three times, on three separate nights, she falls under the sway of a mystical state known as the blood bond. A vampire who holds another in bondage is said to be the victim's regnant, while the being who has been bound is called the thrall. Supernatural powers such as *Dominate* cannot change the victim's feelings for her regnant; only true love has a chance at defeating the bond.

A blood bond must be maintained with further drinks. The relationship has an impact as well: thralls who are constantly abused and humiliated by their regnants find their bond fading fast, while thralls who are treated with affection and respect find it harder to resist their regnants.

Blood bonds are used commonly to ensnare mortals and ghouls in a vampire's web, but it is possible for Cainites to bind each other as well — unlike the generation prohibition of *Dominate*, elders may be bound by the vitae of younger vampires. There are three steps in the process, corresponding to the number of drinks a victim has taken from another character:

**First drink:** At this stage, the drinker has strong flashes of emotion regarding the vampire — the character may find herself daydreaming about the vampire or frequenting areas where she might "stumble across" him. There are no game effects at this stage, but it should be roleplayed.

**Second drink:** While not the vampire's slave, the drinker definitely considers him a central figure in her life. She may do as she pleases, but she must win or tie a Simple Test to take actions directly harmful to the vampire. Furthermore, she is one Trait down to resist any of the vampire's Social Challenges.

![](_page_211_Picture_10.jpeg)

**Third drink:** Full-scale blood bond. Nothing matches the victim's devotion to the vampire — lovers, spouses, even children become secondary to her regnant. A regnant need not even make eye contact to *Dominate* his thrall; the mere sound of his voice is enough, and the thrall is two Traits down to resist the regnant's *Dominate*. Regnants may hold any number of beings in thralldom; furthermore, once bound, a particular thrall may not be fully bound to another vampire while the original bond lasts.

A thrall may resist the bond temporarily by spending a Willpower Trait. The bond may be resisted for one whole scene if the action taken is relatively indirect, while one Willpower Trait is required *per turn* if the thrall wishes to physically attack her regnant.

A blood bond may be broken permanently only in a few ways. First of all, a thrall who manages to avoid *all* contact whatsoever with her regnant for a period of months equal to 12 minus her permanent Willpower rating may find her bond has decreased to the level of a two-drink bond once more. During this time, the character must roleplay the painful process of separation as well as spend Willpower Traits to battle the "addiction" she has to her regnant (Narrator's discretion).

Second, the thrall is sometimes released from the bond if she kills her regnant, though this condition is nowhere as certain as it may seem. Third, at the Narrator's discretion, a character who possesses the Merit: *True Love* to someone other than her regnant may be able to break the bond with the power of her love, but doing so requires arduous, in-depth roleplaying. Finally, some vampires whisper that the Sabbat knows of ways to break the blood bond, but it imparts them to only those who join the sect.

## DERANGEMENTS

Vampires and mortals alike risk developing derangements when faced with overpowering conditions of extreme terror, guilt or anxiety. The Storyteller may decide a derangement is in order after any experience that generates especially intense and unpleasant emotions, or which violates a character's beliefs or ethics severely. All derangements carry "triggers," circumstances which cause the effects of the derangement to become active; once activated, derangements remain in effect for the rest of the scene, and players must modify their character's Traits, attitudes and behavior in accordance with the derangement description. Characters may resist a derangement by expending a Willpower Trait — this effect lasts for one scene, however, if the trigger is still present at the end of that time, the character must spend another Willpower Trait. In the case of particularly intense mental stress, Narrators may rule additional Willpower Traits or a Static Willpower Challenge is required.

It is up to the Storyteller to determine what amount of time and Willpower is required to cure a derangement, and such cures are best left to thoughtful and involved roleplaying rather than simple Trait expenditure. Malkavians may never cure the original derangement(s) brought on by their Clan Disadvantage.

**Note:** There is nothing funny or arbitrary about the way a "crazy" person acts. The insane character is only reacting to the stimuli that he perceives to be real — to *him*, his behavior is perfectly normal. Players should never forget the **Mind's Eye Theatre** rules of safety still apply when roleplaying derangements.

#### Bulimia

Bulimic characters salve their guilt and insecurity by overindulging in activities that comfort them — in this instance, consuming food (or blood, for vampires). Characters with this affliction will gorge themselves as much as possible when under stress, then purge their systems through drastic means and consume more. Characters with this derangement must make a Static Conscience/ Conviction Challenge when feeding; failure means the vampire feeds until his blood pool is full, whether or not he needs the blood. If forcibly kept from feeding, the vampire must resist frenzy.

![](_page_212_Picture_10.jpeg)

![](_page_213_Picture_0.jpeg)

A character with this derangement is prone to experiencing fits of anger with little provocation. While the two bear certain resemblances, this state is quite different from frenzy — frenzy is the instincts of the vampiric Beast, while *Crimson Rage* is a character's own feelings of helplessness and inadequacy. Characters with *Crimson Rage* are not protected from being pushed over the edge into frenzy while insane, however. Whenever this derangement is active, the character gains the Negative Traits: *Violent* x 2 and *Impatient*.

### **Fugue**

Characters suffering this affliction react to stress by adopting a specific set of behaviors; in the process they suffer "blackouts" or periods of memory loss. Whenever confronted by extreme stress, the character must win a Static Willpower Challenge; failure means the character blacks out and the player must roleplay the character's trancelike state. Otherwise, control of the character passes to a Narrator for a scene, who dictates the actions the character takes in order to remove the stress. At the end of the fugue, the character "regains consciousness" with no memory of his actions.

### **Hysteria**

Characters with this derangement are unable to properly control their emotions when subjected to stress or pressure, becoming vulnerable to wild mood swings and fits of intense violence. The vampire must test to resist frenzy any time such stress is present; in addition, whenever the vampire fails in a particularly stressful or prominent instance, she enters frenzy automatically. (Narrators have final say on what classifies as such a dramatic failure.)

### **Immortal Terror**

An insanity most recently identified with a certain reluctant movie vampire, this madness stems from the Cainite's inability to deal with the true scope of his immortality. Terrified by the real implications of living *forever*, the vampire copes by developing a strong unconscious "death wish." Whenever the character is confronted by direct evidence of his immortality — such as attending a funeral or watching a mortal ally die — the character must make a Static Willpower Challenge (difficulty four Traits) to avoid immediately undertaking actions that might result in his destruction. Such actions can be as indirect as breaching the Masquerade by telling a reporter about Kindred society, as long as the act carries potentially deadly consequences. Note that the vampire is not consciously aware that he seeks his own destruction, and he resists attempts to persuade him otherwise.

## **Manic-Depression**

This derangement causes a character to suffer devastating mood swings. Whenever the character fails to achieve a personal goal, she must win a Static Willpower Challenge (no Traits risked) or fall into a depressive state for a number of scenes determined by the Narrator. While depressed, her Willpower Traits are considered halved (round down, minimum one) for purposes of Trait comparison, and she may not spend Blood Traits to raise her Physical Traits. After that, she enters a period of upbeat energy and excitement, pursuing her goals obsessively for a number of scenes equal to the time spent in depression. During this manic time she is one Trait down to resist frenzy.

## **Megalomania**

These individuals have made power the focus of their existence, and such characters must always be the most potent individuals in their environment; where the power stems from is irrelevant, just so long as they are dominant. They believe that other people are divided into two classes: lesser beings and beings elevated beyond their worth. Rivals are considered "competition." Due to their supreme confidence, they are considered one Trait up on all Willpower tests while their derangement is active, but they must also make a Willpower test (difficulty six Traits) to resist any opportunity to commit diablerie during that time.

![](_page_213_Picture_12.jpeg)

![](_page_214_Picture_0.jpeg)

A character with this derangement has suffered mental anguish so severe that his mind reacted by creating additional personas. Each personality is relevant to the trauma that caused it, and the player should work with the Storyteller to determine how many personalities are present, their Natures and what triggers a particular personality. When a personality is triggered, it assumes control until the conditions it was created to deal with have passed. Characters can manifest different Abilities and even Virtues for each personality (all such Traits must still be purchased normally what a personality *believes* it can do can be different from what it is actually capable of), but any such arrangements must be worked out with the Storyteller.

## **Obsessive/Compulsive**

Characters suffering from this derangement are driven to control their environment. Obsessive characters keep one aspect of their life constant — personal cleanliness or keeping things quiet, for example. Compulsive characters perform specific actions or sets of actions, such as washing their hands constantly or always feeding from mortals in a ritualistic fashion. Obsessive/ compulsive characters are one Trait up to resist any attempt to *Dominate* or otherwise coerce them from their set behaviors, but they frenzy automatically if forcibly prevented from adhering to their derangement.

### **Paranoia**

Paranoid beings believe that all their woes and suffering stem from an outside source. Many afflicted beings come up with intricate theories about just who is against them and why; those they suspect of being "one of *them*" are often subject to swift and brutal violence. Paranoid characters trust no one, not even those blood bound to them, and they have a difficult time interacting with others. They are one Trait down on all Social tests while their derangement is active, and any sign of suspicious activity forces them to test to resist frenzy.

### **Regression**

Characters suffering from this affliction avoid facing responsibilities or consequences by retreating to a younger state where less was required of them. During this state they may alternate between times of whimsy and temper tantrums, but they will always seek to put a more powerful individual between them and whatever is plaguing them. Victims are two Traits down on all Mental Challenges.

## **Sanguinary Animism**

This illness is unique to vampires, a response to guilt for feeding on mortals. Afflicted vampires believe that they do not merely consume a victim's blood, but part of his soul as well. The vampire hears her victim's voice inside her head and is assaulted by "memories" of the victim's life — all created by the vampire's subconscious. Whenever the vampire feeds on a mortal, she must make a Static Willpower Challenge; success means she is distracted as above and is one Trait down on all challenges for the remainder of the scene. Failure means the character gains a second angry, reproachful personality bent on driving her to ruin. The character is at a one-Trait penalty to all actions for the duration of the madness, and he must roleplay the inner conflict involved; this madness lasts until the moments just before dawn.

## **Schizophrenia**

Individuals with this derangement have had their psyche fractured by terrible, unresolvable inner conflicts. Most people conceive of this type of disorder when they envision insanity; victims might imagine crucified rabbits floating after them, or swear that their dead father is telling them to murder their uncle. This disorder is anything but arbitrary — the player should work with the Storyteller to determine a general set of behaviors relevant to the original trauma. Kindred with this derangement are unpredictable and dangerous — in situations where their inner conflict flares up, they must automatically retest any win to resist frenzy, and they are two Traits down on all Willpower tests.

![](_page_215_Picture_0.jpeg)

Of all the crimes known to the Kindred, none is more feared than the soul-stealing sin known as diablerie, or the Amaranth. Those convicted of this crime suffer the harshest punishments in the Camarilla, and the mere suspicion of diablerie is enough to spark city-wide blood hunts. Still, no punishment is harsh enough to end this forbidden practice, for diablerie offers a seductive way of increasing one's power.

### **Committing Diablerie**

Diablerie is divided into four distinct stages. First the diablerist must incapacitate his target; only after the target is physically immobilized may diablerie commence. The diablerist then drains her victim dry, taking one Blood Trait automatically per turn. Then the diablerist must strip the target's health levels away until she puts him in torpor (if he isn't there already). The target may resist this process with a Physical Challenge per health level, but he may bid only stamina-related Traits, and he cannot injure the diablerist as a result of the challenge. If the diablerist ever cannot match the victim's Physical Traits, she falls away and the target can die quietly. Likewise, a vampire draining health levels cannot be targeted by any Mental or Social Challenges, but she also cannot defend herself, and any attempts to attack her or pull her away succeed automatically.

If a victim is drained dry of blood and reduced to torpor, the final struggle begins, as the diablerist tries to ensnare the victim's soul before it can escape. This effort is a Physical Challenge, and the victim is three Traits up. The diablerist may continue trying until she can no longer match the victim's Physical Traits — success means she absorbs the target's soul into her own, while ultimate failure means the target's spirit flees to the afterlife.

A character may have other characters assist him in incapacitating his target and even in draining the target of Blood Traits and health levels, but only one Kindred can gain the ultimate benefits of diablerie. However, the seduction of the process is very strong — a character who wishes to halt diablerie after the third stage

Note: You *cannot* diablerize anything but another vampire. A mortal soul, with no torpor state in between life and death, flees as soon as its body is killed, as does the soul of a faerie, werebeast or any other supernatural critter some Lick makes a meal out of. You may drain such beings of their blood and even kill them, but soul *tartar* is strictly a Cainite delicacy.

#### Rewards of Diablerie

On successful completion of diablerie, the diablerist is overcome by euphoria, and he must check to avoid frenzy immediately; the diablerist has literally taken the victim's soul into her own. The true benefit of diablerie becomes apparent, however, if the victim was of a lower generation than the diablerist (e.g., a ninth-generation vampire diablerizing a seventh-generation vampire): By stealing the other Kindred's soul, the diablerist effectively raises her own generation by one, bringing her closer to Caine and otherwise conferring all the benefits of the new generation on the vampire. The character also gains two extra Experience Traits at the end of the session.

If the victim was of much greater power (five or more generation levels), the diablerist may gain more than one generation; ultimately, however, the decision is up to the Storyteller.

If the victim was sufficiently powerful, the diablerist may experience a temporary surge in her Disciplines. Any increases are granted solely at the Narrator's discretion, and in no event do these boosted Disciplines last for more than one scene.

#### Perils of Diablerie

Many neonates believe diablerie to be the perfect crime: the body is destroyed in the process, making it difficult to secure enough evidence to support an accusation of murder. However, diablerists quickly learn that there are several ways of learning the identity of those who have committed this heinous sin. Storytellers are encouraged to remember the horrific magnitude of the crime and ensure that diablerie never goes on casually.

- First, and most importantly, a character with Humanity *always* loses at least one Humanity Trait *permanently* for committing such a heinous act, and he might even lose more if the deed was especially foul no test, no appeal. Even characters on a Path stand to lose a Path Trait for such a horrible crime, unless their Path specifically condones it.
- A vampire using the Auspex Discipline of *Aura Perception* may detect diablerie on a character's aura for up to three months after the diablerie was committed; this crime appears as black veins running through the offender's aura.
- Likewise, a vampire using the *Thaumaturgy* Discipline power *A Taste for Blood* may detect diablerie the character has committed, *regardless* of how long ago the crime occurred.
- In the Camarilla, a vampire revealed to have committed diablerie is subject to an immediate blood hunt, and he may even have the blood hunt extended to other cities if her crime was heinous enough. What's worse, many such blood hunts have stipulations allowing the hunters to feed on the blood of the diablerist herself, and many princes look the other way if the hunters "accidentally" diablerize the criminal themselves. This legalized kinslaying makes most young Kindred eager to expose any diablerists among them.
- Certain legends speak of diablerists displaying some of the mannerisms of their victims, especially if their victim was exceptionally strong-willed or of a greatly lower generation than the diablerist. Naturally, clever Storytellers will be quick to pick up on this trait when dealing with habitual diablerists.

## STATUS

Kindred have developed many intricate rules of protocol and procedure when dealing with each other. Power-hungry vampires vie for positions of im-

![](_page_216_Picture_15.jpeg)

portance in the great Jyhad constantly, and a vampire's reputation can be more valuable than any Influence or Discipline in some situations. Learning to play the power-games of the elders is a long and arduous task for neonates, but in the end one that serves most of them well — or hastens their demise.

Status is the measure of a vampire's reputation, and is measured in Traits. Most often, it usually stems from an office held among the local Kindred, from prince to primogen to scourge. Such posts are never given out, and those who hold them tend to defend them zealously. However, a vampire may also gain Status by being influential in the city's business, performing extraordinary deeds or by simply catching the right eyes at the right time.

Camarilla Status Traits: Acknowledged, Admired, Adored, Cherished, Esteemed, Exalted, Famous, Faultless, Feared, Honorable, Influential, Just, Praised, Respected, Revered, Trustworthy, Well-Connected, Well-Known.

Troupes should feel free to invent new Status Traits to suit their own stories and the reputations of the characters receiving the Traits.

## Gaining and Losing Status

All vampires who have been officially "accepted" by the prince acquire a single Status Trait: Acknowledged. Failure to possess this Trait means that a character cannot expect even the most simple favors from local Kindred, and he may even be hunted by the scourge if the prince discovers his presence. Most Masquerade characters will either start with this, or acquire it early on in the chronicle.

Characters may gain Status by helping uphold the Traditions (especially the Masquerade), doing favors for the prince or an elder, saving the unlife of a prominent Kindred, or defeating a Sabbat menace in the city. A city officer (such as the sheriff or keeper of Elysium) may recommend a Kindred for Status if she has been particularly useful or has assisted them in their work. On occasion, the prominent may award Status to those who hindered their enemies or overthrew them, but such notice may not always be a good thing.

Naturally, a character may lose Status as easily as he gains it (if not more so). Falsely accusing another vampire of a crime, violating the Traditions, committing diablerie or refusing to recognize the Status of another Kindred are but a few of the ways to earn such displeasure. Of course, if there are no witnesses to report such violations.

A character may never gain more than one Status Trait per story. There are two exceptions to this rule: if the prince rewards or sanctions an additional Trait, or if the Status Traits are conferred when a Kindred assumes an office in Kindred society. However, a character can *lose* more than one Status per story, USING STATUS

Status comes in two types: permanent and temporary. Permanent Status is recorded on the character sheet, and is a measure of a character's actual standing in Kindred society; permanent Status losses or gains are added or removed from your character sheet. By contrast, the loss or gain of temporary Status has no effect on permanent Status and tends to fluctuate more. Temporary Status Traits can be represented with Status Cards (since they tend to change hands often).

You may bid a Status Trait instead of a regular Trait in any applicable Social Challenge. You may also choose to add Status Traits to your Social Traits during a Social Challenge if Traits are compared. You must tell your opponent when you wish to use your Status Traits in these ways, however, since they may choose to ignore them if they like. Such a disrespectful act typically means a loss of permanent Status for the offending Kindred, unless the vampire ignored was far less influential than the offender. Some form of punishment should be expected, though — elders consider those who flout the system dangerously disruptive.

EXAMPLES OF STATUS

The following are some examples of the uses and benefits of Status:

- Temporary Status may be used to add to your Social Traits during an applicable Social Challenge. (Note: This benefit does not include Discipline use, unless the Storyteller approves of such usage specifically.)
- Status is a measure of a character's creditability. In any situation where it is one vampire's word against another, Status can be the determining factor. The same is true in the case of accusing another of a crime in which there is no concrete evidence. In all such cases, the character with the most Status is the one whose word is accepted.
- You may loan temporary Status to another to show your favor, though the individual to which you made the loan must return it immediately on the asking. The bearer may spend this Trait as a temporary Trait, after which it is gone for the duration of the story. (This is the only way a character's temporary Status can rise above her permanent Status rating.) Loaned Status can be used exactly as you would use your own. You can give only one Trait of Status to any one person in this fashion.
- You must possess at least one Trait of Status in order to petition the prince for any reason.
- Anyone of higher Status may remove permanent Status from those lower than themselves at a cost of one permanent Status Trait per Trait removed. Temporary Status may be removed in the same fashion. This is often done as punishment, including removing the Status of Acknowledged and thus leaving the person at the mercy of the scourge.
- You may grant permanent Status to another of your own clan if he has less than half your permanent Status. The cost for such a boon is one temporary Status Trait, and the boon must be made publicly, such as during a meeting of the primogen or another such gathering.
- A clan may remove one Status Trait from an elder of the clan by expending a group total of permanent Status Traits equal to the elder's permanent Status. The primogen may also lower the prince's permanent Status in the same fashion.
- Remember, you may only gain one Status Trait per story, but you may lose more than one Trait. Again, there are two exceptions to this rule: Status granted or sanctioned by the prince, and Status received for assuming a station.

#### STATIONS

There are eight official stations that a Kindred may hold, each of which grants Status within a city. Cities with small Kindred populations may double up certain stations, or even leave positions vacant. It is highly recommended that the most powerful stations should remain in the hands of Narrators and more experienced players, with newer players learning the ropes before taking a shot at attaining a station.

Certain powers and responsibilities are inherent in each of these stations, and all powers that a station confers are lost immediately if a character is removed from or relinquishes it. The following is a list of the eight standard stations:

#### The Prince

- The prince of a city automatically gains three additional Status Traits: *Exalted*, *Well-Known* and *Famous*. He can never lose these Traits permanently while remaining prince.
- The prince can remove one permanent Status Trait from someone at a cost of one temporary Status Trait per Trait removed.
- The prince can grant permanent Status Traits to any Kindred at a cost of one temporary Trait for each Trait awarded. The prince (and only the prince) may thus break

#### Seneschal

- The seneschal gains the following two additional Status Traits: *Cherished* and *Esteemed*. The character can never lose these Traits permanently while remaining seneschal.
- The seneschal can act in the prince's stead when the prince is out of the city. He is therefore entitled to all of the powers of the prince, although the prince may reverse or revoke them at any time.

#### Primogen

- Primogen members each receive the additional Status Trait: *Revered* when they join the primogen. As long as the character remains one of the primogen, she cannot lose this Trait permanently.
- Primogen may grant or remove permanent Status Traits to or from any member of their clan at a cost of one temporary Status Trait for each Trait granted or removed.

#### Harpies

- The leader of the harpies receives the additional Status Trait: *Influential* on attaining the position. As long as the character remains the leader, he cannot lose this Trait permanently.
- The harpy automatically gets one temporary Status Trait from each member of the primogen, who bestow these Status Traits to demonstrate their support of the harpies. The harpy, in turn, may use these Traits however she desires, even against the owner.
- The harpy may remove one permanent Status Trait from a Kindred who has backed out of a boon or is part of a major scandal. There is no cost for doing so, although there must be a grain of truth to the scandal. The harpy must produce some sort of evidence at a gathering of Kindred, at which time the Status Trait is removed.
- The harpy may restore Status he has removed at a cost of one temporary Trait per Trait removed.
- The leader of the harpies may sponsor lesser harpies by giving another Kindred a Status Trait of his own. Lesser harpies may remove temporary Status just as the head harpy removes permanent Status, although their leader may choose to make such loss permanent.

#### Whips

• Whips have the same powers as the primogen, although they do not gain an additional Status Trait, and their powers may be revoked at any time by the primogen of their clan.

#### Sheriff

- The sheriff gains the additional Status Trait: Feared when he attains the position. While he remains sheriff, he cannot permanently lose this Trait.
- The sheriff may demand that any Kindred within the city accompany him for questioning or judgment. Failure to do so causes the offender to lose one permanent Status Trait.
- The sheriff is immune to the powers of the keeper of Elysium (those conferred by the position, that is; he must still honor the Traditions).
- The sheriff may sponsor deputies by giving another Kindred a Status Trait of his own. These deputies have the same powers as the sheriff, but the sheriff may revoke their authority at any time.

#### Keeper of Elysium

• The keeper of Elysium gains the additional Status Trait: *Honorable* on attaining the office. As long as the character remains the keeper, he cannot lose this Trait permanently.
