## **Leadership**

When you speak, people listen. A good speaking voice and self-confidence lend a powerful presence to a leader. The *Leadership* Ability represents your ability to motivate people and to get them to follow your guidance. Even among those who do not know or respect you, you can demand attention.

You can use *Leadership* with a Social Challenge to try to get a minor favor or task from a character. *Leadership* is also used with many *Presence* powers.

## **Linguistics**

You've studied a language — or languages — other than your native tongue. Whether you're an older vampire whose childhood language is no longer spoken, you frequent the global community, or it is necessary for other studies, you can speak, write and read other languages.

You must choose one language for each level of *Linguistics* you possess. Thus, you could have *Linguistics: Cantonese* and *Linguistics: German*. Alternately, you can focus on the underlying study of *Linguistics* itself, granting some understanding of the principles behind the structure of language. Languages need not be spoken; American Sign Language or Egyptian hieroglyphics would also be considered fields for study. Those who wish to converse in another language (but cannot actually do so) should hold up one hand with the first finger and thumb making an L-shape to indicate to other players the characters are not speaking English. Those who wish to listen in must also possess the language.

### **Medicine**

You know how the human (and, to a lesser extent, Cainite) body functions. You can speed the recovery and healing of an injured mortal, or you can use your knowledge to inflict injury. Many Cainites learn just enough to know where to bite their victims or how to punish their ghouls.

You can use the *Medicine* Ability to speed a mortal's healing by one category: a *Wounded* mortal would heal as if *Bruised*, for instance. *Medicine* may be used for other sorts of research and lab work with a Mental Challenge. As *Medicine* represents such a vast field, your Storyteller may require you to specify what you know (*Pharmaceuticals*, *Internal Medicine*, *General Practice*).

### **Melee**

If you've got something in your hands, you're a deadly fighter. Be it a sword, a stick or a set of nunchaku, you can use it to damaging effect. Expend *Melee* for retests in hand-to-hand combat when you are using a close combat weapon like a knife or a chair. Certain weapons function best when wielded by a character with *Melee*.

### **Occult**

The hidden world teems with mysterious secrets. By unlocking universal keys and studying the basics of spirituality, you can learn the shadowy paths of the cosmos. Your *Occult* Ability serves as a general knowledge of the supernatural, alerting you to the existence of many varied sorts of inhuman creatures and paranormal events.

Some Disciplines, most notably *Thaumaturgy*, rely on the *Occult* Ability. *Occult* grants some basic (and sometimes erroneous) knowledge of the various denizens of the supernatural world; for more detailed information, study *Expert Ability: Lore* in your particular subject of interest.

You are a true virtuoso. Whatever your chosen medium, you have a gift for artistic endeavors. Whether playing an instrument, singing, dancing or acting, your skills allow you to entertain and even earn money.

Your *Performance* Ability can be used to earn a modest income, just like other artistic trade skills. If you execute a work with *Performance* x 3 or better, you may transfix Toreador in the area with the beauty and grace of your style.

You must choose a specific art form when you take *Performance*, such as playing an instrument, singing, acting or dramatic readings. Note that *Performance* is generally anything done before an audience, while *Expression* most often focuses on literary works, and *Crafts* concentrates on the creation of physical objects (such as paintings or sculptures).

### **Politics**

The world of influence-trading and favors is extensive enough among mortals. In vampire society, where one's prowess is measured in standing with one's peers, the game of *Politics* is all-consuming. Through observation, intrigue and a bit of spin-doctoring, you've learned how to handle appearances, what a speech *really*  means, and where the deal-making is going on. In short, it's *Politics* as usual.

The *Politics* Ability is useful primarily in dealings with mortal society or Influence. You may be able to manipulate the outcome of local political actions, with the proper Influence and some well-placed Social Challenges; *Politics* Ability ensures that matters proceed in the direction that you desire. *Politics* is also used to discern hidden motives and broker deals, and as such, it is almost a requirement of any harpy. With *Politics*, you can usually set an appropriate level of debt for a prestation boon. The hierarchies of power are often obvious to you, granting you insight into whether the prince is really in charge, or is simply a puppet of the primogen, for example. *Politics* also makes you aware of who's in favor and who's out, and you can determine how much Status a particular vampire possesses once introduced. (If you know your quarry's name, expend a *Politics* Ability to determine the subject's Status Traits.)

A knowledge of *Politics* includes, by extension, an understanding of the bureaucratic levels of power. You know how to cut through red tape, or how to obstruct others with it. By determining who's important in a given strata, you can usually avoid wasting time and simply go straight to the person with the power to do what you want.

## **Repair**

You possess a working understanding of what makes things tick. With times, tools and parts, you can fix or slightly alter most of the trappings of modern society. This knowledge also allows you to excel at sabotage. The *Repair* Ability is widespread among inventors, mechanics and handymen. Using this Ability usually calls for a Mental Challenge, the difficulty of which depends on such factors as the item's complexity, tools and parts available, extent of damage and time spent on the repairs.

## **Science**

The modern Information Age sees the explosion of all manner of studies. Categorizing and breaking down the world into many different forms, the methods of logic and reason give sentient beings the means to understand the universe, or at least small pieces of it. Education in *Science* covers techniques of inquiry, modern studies and a broad range of underpinning work in a diverse range of fields.

*Science* Ability requires an area of particular study: *Biology*, *Chemistry*, *Physics*, *Metallurgy*, *Electrical Engineering*, *Mathematics*, *Geology* and *Botany* are all possibilities, though such a list is far from comprehensive. Combining a *Science* with different fields may give a wide variety results. For example, *Science: Metallurgy* with *Academics* may give results regarding historical research and theory, while the same *Science* with

![](_page_91_Picture_13.jpeg)

![](_page_92_Picture_0.jpeg)

Using a particular branch of *Science* usually requires a Mental Challenge of some sort to determine the success of research or the viability of theoretical work.

## **Security**

Whichever side of the law you've worked on has granted you experience in *Security*  techniques. You know about police operations and guard work, how they make their schedules and how they undertake their business — and how to disrupt such operations. Locks, traps, security systems and alarms are all within your purview. With a little time, you can put together *Security* measures for a location; you can also defeat such measures.

Use the *Security* Ability with Mental Traits to set up a secure area or network, or to formulate a plan for breaching such a network. *Security* Ability is also used to disarm traps, alarms and other devices, and to defeat locks. At the discretion of a Narrator, you may be required to use a Physical Trait related to dexterity when attempting to bypass a physical lock or alarm.

## **Scrounge**

You're exceptionally good at finding *stuff*. Whether it's a crucial part for a 1890s' gramaphone, invitations to the most exclusive gallery opening in town, or just haven space in the downtown, you're a wiz at knowing where to go, who to talk to and how to get what you need. Granted, the things you get are rarely brand-new or exactly right and do take time and favors to acquire. Still such an ability is useful when your finances are less than sparkling or theft is out of the question.

*Scrounge* is typically used in conjunction with Mental Traits (although the Storyteller may occasionally require a Social Challenge for haggling), and can be useful when looking for particular items or searching a place that is in shambles.

### **Stealth**

By blending into cover, blurring your lines and moving carefully and quietly, you can evade notice or sneak past people. You know how best to take advantage of surrounding cover and how to use light and shadow. Opportunities for unnoticed movement are not lost on you, as you understand the uses of timing and diversion.

With an appropriate Physical Challenge, you can sometimes sneak past the notice of guards and searchers (who contest your Ability with their Mental Traits and *Investigation* Ability). You also use *Stealth* to augment the *Obfuscate* Discipline.

### **Streetwise**

Word on the street is known to you. Even if you don't have any particular friends or contacts in the area, you know about the different communities and gangs that hang out in town. You recognize tagging and other territorial markers, and you know some of the signs, colors and clothes that denote street people, homeless, gangbangers, hoodlums, criminals and social workers.

Using the *Streetwise* Ability, with your Mental Traits, lets you recognize the influence of various gangs or street communities. You also know about criminal organizations and activities, and you could perform a little larceny yourself. An appropriate Social Challenge can help smooth dealings with a hostile gang (though you may need *Etiquette* to make a really good impression).

## **Subterfuge**

There are many ways to talk about subjects, and equally many ways to uncover the truth of the matter. Even in idle conversation, people use little white lies, slip hints about their true motives, try to guide the course of discussion and give away their secrets indirectly. The art of *Subterfuge* is the art of reading these tricks and using them effortlessly.

#### Survival

Survival Ability represents a knowledge of terrain, how to find shelter, where to find water, techniques in hunting, edible and poisonous plants and fungi and so on. Though a vampire needs only blood to live, use of Survival makes hunting of animals much easier, and it provides some assurances of a safer existence for those who travel outside the cities.

Hunting and avoiding danger in the wilderness usually relies on a Physical Challenge. With *Survival*, you can substitute your Mental Traits if you so desire. *Survival* is also a measure of the character's ruggedness and ability to overcome obstacles and injury, so it can be used in retests of the *Fortitude* and *Protean* Disciplines.

## Backgrounds

Your character's Backgrounds help to flesh out ties with mortal agencies, role in vampire society and beneficial resources available. Each Background is used differently. In general, having multiple Traits in a given Background allows for better or more common use of that benefit. Some Background directly affect your character's creation and development; others are called into play later during the game.

#### ALLIES

A few friends, either kept from your mortal days or made after the Embrace, help you out in your endeavors. You can make a few calls and cut a few deals to get assistance in a wide range of activities. Your Storyteller will probably require you to define how you keep your allies and their relations to you.

Each Allies Trait possessed represents one person that you can call on for aid. Unlike Influence, your Allies have special talents that make them better than the average person on the street. Though your allies may not be aware of your vampire nature, they can be quite useful if directed properly.

In general, your allies do not show up in play directly. Instead, you can use them for certain services between play sessions, by notifying your Storyteller:

- An ally can be directed to follow up on research or activities that you have started. If you undertook a specific task previously, like tailing someone, researching a project or building a device, your allies can continue the work, doing so with one Ability Trait's worth of expertise. As long as they work on the project, your *Allies* Trait for the individual is tied up.
- If you need a particularly competent ally, you can expend multiple Traits to gain access to a mortal with multiple levels of an Ability or Influence. Each *Allies* Trait that you spend after the first gives an extra level of expertise to your allies. They may use this expertise on your behalf, though rarely with your own skill, and they only help as long as you tie up your *Allies* Background Traits in this manner.
- An ally can help you to hunt, though obviously, it's not a good idea to rely on your allies as blood sources, or to even tell them exactly what they're doing when they bring people to you. Each Trait of *Allies* that you use for hunting lets you make a Simple Test. A win or tie grants you one additional Blood Trait. Doing so counts as a project that lasts for the entire time between game sessions.

Be wary of calling on your allies too often. An ally may call on you for mutual aid or refuse to help if pressed into dangerous or illegal activities.

![](_page_93_Picture_14.jpeg)

#### CONTACTS

With the right contacts in all walks of life, you can get a line on all sorts of useful information. Although having an "ear to the wall" doesn't necessarily provide you with good help or loyal servants, it does mean that you know who to ask when looking for the movers and shakers behind the scenes.

In game terms, your rating in Contacts allows you to discern rumors and information. When you call on your contacts, you make a few phone calls, check with likely snitches and grease a few palms. In return, you get rumors and information as if possessed of a certain amount of Influence. Doing so lets you find out exactly what's going on in the city within a particular area. You can get information of a level equal to however many contacts you use. If you use Contacts x 3 on Industry, for instance, you get information as if digging up dirt with Industry x 3 Influence. The advantage of the Contacts Background is that contacts can be switched from place to place each game, getting information in different areas at your demand.

Using Contacts for especially dangerous or secret information may require you to spend some money or perform a few favors, at the discretion of a Storyteller. On occasion, accidents can cause contacts in one area to dry up, such as a strike that affects your Industry contacts, or a particularly unlucky astronomical conjunction sends your Occult contacts running for the hills. Your contacts will not generally function as aides or lackeys; that is the purview of the Allies and Retainers Backgrounds.

**Example:** Langley, a Nosferatu, has Contacts x 5. This month, his player, Robert, decides that Langley is going to engage in a little corporate espionage. Robert allocates Contacts x 4 to Industry, learning about local projects and where they're bound for; he leaves one level of Contacts in reserve, for life's little emergencies. Next month, he plans to use his contacts to find an Underworld buyer for his secrets.

#### FAME

Some vampires are Embraced from among the ranks of the wealthy or talented elite. As a result, many Cainites can make a claim to some distinction in their breathing days. Though such notoriety often fades with the years, your Fame lingers on to influence mortal society.

Fame allows you to exercise your connections over a longer distance than usual. Certainly, if you've got the right Influence, you can push things around on an interstate or even national scale, but with Fame, you can just make a few calls and get your Contacts, Influence or Resources exerted over a greater range without any impediment. This is not to say you must have Fame to get anything done, only that it may help. Your total Fame determines your maximum range for unimpeded use of your Contacts, Influence and Resources.

When you make an effort to exert your *Contacts*, Influence or *Resources* over a long range, you lean on your popularity and image, thus expending your *Fame* Traits until the next game session. *Fame* is most often used in the downtime between sessions to facilitate long-range plans.

| Fame Ranges |                               |  |
|-------------|-------------------------------|--|
| Fame Traits | Maximum Range for Backgrounds |  |
| Fame x 1    | Local scene                   |  |
| Fame x 2    | City                          |  |
| Fame x 3    | State                         |  |
| Fame x 4    | Adjoining states              |  |
| Fame x 5    | Entire country                |  |

![](_page_94_Picture_10.jpeg)

In a less mechanical fashion, your *Fame* also dictates how recognizable you are to mortals, for one reason or another. The Storyteller will certainly make the effects of your *Fame* apparent, and mortals may take notice of you at bothersome times. Being profiled on "America's Most Wanted" or spotted at the Academy Awards does things to one's repuation, after all.

Fame does have its limitations. It makes little sense for you to have this Background if you're known to be dead in the mortal world. Also, Fame does not always indicate widespread instant name recognition; you may only be known to a subset of a particular group, or a recognized expert in a field who's unknown to those outside.

|            |             | Generation     |       |           |
|------------|-------------|----------------|-------|-----------|
| Generation | Max. Traits | Max. Abilities | Blood | Willpower |

| Twelve     | 10          | 5              | 11/1  | 2/8       |
| Eleven     | 11          | 5              | 12/1  | 4/8       |

| Six        | 18          | 7              | 30/6  | 8/16      |
| Five       | 20          | 8              | 40/8  | 9/18      |
| Four       | 25          | 9              | 50/10 | 10/20     |
| Three      | 30          | ?              | ?     | ?         |

Max. Traits shows your maximum number of total Traits in your primary area of development. As an *optional* rule, your Storyteller may lower this quantity by one in your secondary Attribute and by two in your tertiary Attribute, meaning that you will always have your best potential in your strongest original Attribute area. This limit does not count against Bonus Traits, but you can never claim more than twice your maximum Traits even with bonuses.

Max. Abilities is the maximum levels you can take in any one Ability. With a maximum of five, for instance, you cannot advance beyond Melee x 5, though you may take multiple focused Abilities (Crafts: Woodworking x 5 and Crafts: Leatherworking x 5). Optionally, your Storyteller may allow you to exceed this limit by one in one Ability in which you have a particular area of study.

Blood is your maximum number of Blood Traits. You can hold that amount of blood in your system. The number after the slash is how many Blood Traits you can spend in any given turn. Optionally, your Storyteller may choose to use a "compressed pool" for ease of play. Under such a system, characters have half the Blood Traits listed here, rounded up, but all other functions remain the same (exception: the *Thaumaturgy Path of Conjuring* Blood Trait costs are also halved, rounding up; characters come into play with two Traits of blood if they lose a Blood Test at the beginning of a game). This system makes for faster combat resolution and less bookkeeping, but it also makes vampires less powerful. All vampires in a system should use the same Blood Trait scale.

Willpower lists your starting Willpower Traits before the slash, and your maximum Willpower Traits after the slash. Should the Storyteller choose to use the compressed Blood Pool, characters have half the Willpower listed (rounded up).

![](_page_95_Picture_7.jpeg)

![](_page_96_Picture_0.jpeg)

*Generation* is the measure of one's fundamental closeness to Caine. Each vampire is Embraced from a long chain of sire to childe, and the blood weakens with each passing. Those Embraced by a sire closer in the chain to Caine and the Antediluvians find that their blood is strengthened by that proximity. The less scrupulous among the younger generations steal this power through the foul process of diablerie. Since a vampire's sheer power and eventual potential are limited by *Generation*, much of vampire society is ordered by those of low *Generation* (close to Caine) while the neonates of weak, thin blood and high *Generation* (many steps removed) champ at a bit that cannot be removed.

You must spend one Background or Free Trait for each *Generation* purchased. Thus, if your character is of the 10th generation, you must spend three Background or Free Traits for this privilege. The Storyteller may place a limit on how low the generation spread may go.

The total number of Traits placed in this Background determines your exact generation. You start at the 13th generation, and drop one generation for each Trait spent — thus, with five Traits of *Generation*, you are of the eighth generation removed from Caine. (You could theoretically have a "negative generation" by taking the Flaw *Fourteenth Generation* — see p. 114.)

Your generation affords great power, for it determines your ultimate potential and raw potency of blood. However, being of low generation also makes you a tempting target for would-be diablerists, who seek to steal your vitae to enrich their own.

# herd

Whether surrounding yourself with mortal cultists, or just making sure that you have regular access to a blood bank, your herd gives you a guaranteed volume of blood for feeding. You don't have to go very far to hunt; your herd, when available to you, offers you a safe and easy way to sustain your powers.

You should work with your Storyteller to describe the exact nature of your herd, since these Traits can be lost through hazards or deliberate sabotage. You could have mortals who are conditioned to enjoy the Kiss, access to medical blood supplies outside of the normal channels or a religious cult that gives you blood freely. Each Trait of *Herd* can be used to gain one extra Blood Trait once per session. You can do this immediately on entering the game to represent that you have previously fed, thus improving your blood from your starting Traits for the evening (based on your Blood Test, as described on p. 106). You can also take 15 minutes out of play to call on a herd and gain a Blood Trait. You can split up *Herd* Traits if you wish, so you may use some Traits to start with extra blood, then use more later to replace spent vitae.

Members of your herd (assuming it is composed of people and not plastic bags) are not necessarily particularly competent or loyal — they simply let you feed from them. You must take *Allies* or *Retainers* if you want them to do other tasks for you.

**Example:***Xavier, a 10th-generation Tremere, has* Herd *x 3. The player, Paul, ties on his Blood Test as he enters play. He starts with half his blood pool (rounded up), or seven Blood Traits. Paul decides to expend* Herd *x 1 to gain one additional Trait before play, placing him at eight Blood Traits. Later, after a particularly strenuous Thaumaturgical battle, he is in desperate need of sustenance, so the player marks off another* Herd *x 2 and spends 30 minutes out of play. Xavier returns with two extra Blood Traits.*

# inFluenCe

Mortal society builds on institutions. As humans raise their cities, they form gatherings of expertise that are manipulated by the Cainites hiding in their midst. If

![](_page_96_Picture_12.jpeg)

you have Influence, you can sway the direction of some areas of mortal society, pushing cities to grow as you direct. Your Influence can be used to strike indirectly at your foes while protecting your own assets, or to gain information and special resources.

Influence comes in many different areas. You must allocate Traits separately to each Influence; thus, if you have *Legal* x 4, you could still have *Police* x3 independently but you would have to spend the Traits for each.

You cannot manage more Influence than the sum of your permanent Physical, Social and Mental Traits combined. This limit counts against all of your total Influence — your combined levels cannot exceed this total. After all, there are only so many things you can do in a night.

When you exercise Influence, you expend temporary Influence Traits. The tables for various Influence areas detail what you can do with a specific number of Traits. Performing an action requires a number of Traits equal to the level of the action; you must use three Traits to perform an action listed at the third level of an Influence chart, for instance. Thus, with high levels of Influence, you can perform many small actions, or a few significant ones.

Certain levels of Influence gift you with items, money or aides. Unlike the *Resources* Background, money and equipment garnered with Influence does not come automatically each month. If you want a steady income from Influence, you must direct your Influence in that direction continually, and this income does not come with any associated trappings of wealth (you'd have to buy a house and car separately, for instance). Aides garnered with Influence generally help only for one specific task, and they usually only have the equivalent of one level of Ability in their area of skill — for more competent and readily available help, take *Allies*.

Most cities have only a set amount of Influence in various areas. For instance, Atlanta has a great deal of *Transportation* Influence, because it is a hub of travel, while Hollywood would have a lot of *High Society* and *Media* Influence. A Rust-Belt city where manufacturing and heavy industry has all but disappeared would have very little to no *Industry* Influence.

Storytellers should map out the total amount of each type of Influence to be had in the city. Once all of the Influence of a given type is used up, the only way to get more is to use Influence to grow that area of society (making new projects or sponsoring investment), to destroy someone else's Influence and thus free up those resources, or to acquire an adversary's Influence in an area. Also, each city may have different reflections of the Influences listed here. A city with a thriving independent film community is going to have a different picture of *Media* or *High Society* than a city where the arts are being literally starved out due to budget cuts.

Each area of Influence has its own description. Elder vampires may possess truly far-reaching Influence, giving them the power to exert control beyond the levels included here.

## BureauCraCy

You can manage various government agencies and bureaus. By dealing with social programs and public servants, you can spin red tape, bypass rules and regulations or twist bureaucratic regimentation to your advantage. *Bureaucracy* is useful in operating or shutting down businesses, faking or acquiring permits and identification papers and manipulating public utilities and facilities. Government clerks at the city and county level, utility workers, road crews, surveyors and other civil servants are potential contacts or allies.

## ChurCh

Though the modern church has arguably less control over temporal society than it did in the Middle Ages, its policies still exert considerable influence over the direction of politics and communities. Knowing the appropriate people allows insight into many mainstream religions, such as Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Shinto or Buddhism (fringe or alternative groups, such as Scientology, are considered *Occult*). When you exercise *Church* Influence, you can change religious policy, affect the assignment of clergy and access a variety of lore and resources. Contacts and allies affected by *Church* Influence would include ministers, priests, bishops, Church-sponsored witch-hunters, holy orders and various attendees and assistants.

## FinanCe

Manipulating markets, stock reports and investments is a hobby of many Cainites, especially those who use their knowledge to keep hidden wealth. Though your actual available money is a function of your *Resources*, you can use *Finance* Influence to start or smother businesses, crush or support banking institutions and alter credit records. Clearly, such power over money is not to be trifled with — fortunes are made and destroyed with this sort of pull. CEOs, bankers, stockbrokers, bank tellers, yes-men, financiers and loan agents are found among such work.

## health

Some vampires rely on connections in the medical community to acquire blood. Necromancers and practitioners of arcane arts may also require body parts or medical data to further their studies. Furthermore, maintaining the Masquerade often calls for alteration of medical records or faking of particular diseases; some Cainites even specialize in the study of blood-borne ailments. All of these sorts of research and development fall under the purview of *Health* Influence. Coroners, doctors, lab workers, therapists, pharmacists and specialists are just a few of the folks found in this field.
