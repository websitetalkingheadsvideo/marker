players — the settings, scenes and events of each game session exist only within their collective imagination. But during a **Masquerade** game, the story becomes flesh, as it were. The characters are present at a particular physical location, and they (to a greater or lesser degree) actually perform their actions as time passes normally. Perhaps more importantly, the Storyteller no longer has the luxury of manipulating the entire story secretly at a moment's notice. She can no longer describe each and every scene in minute detail. She must rely on a few well-chosen sentences and suggestive props to convey the appropriate sensory details to the players.

Fortunately, a good **Masquerade** game features one important characteristic that is less prevalent in standard game sessions: The players will take the key ingredients the Storyteller provides and create many of their own stories. Together, the Storyteller and players realize a roleplaying experience that is more intense than most traditional tabletop games.

# key story ingredients

Assemble your story ingredients like a master chef — or a mad scientist, if you prefer — paying careful attention to the type, form and shape of each before adding it to your creation. Careless selection of important story elements has led to the early death of more than one game, and you must learn to separate the truly good ideas from those that sound good on paper. It isn't always easy to tell one from the other, but exercising your own best judgment is often the means to learn to distinguish between them. Remember, however, that in this endeavor, experimentation will often produce results more interesting than you might expect!

theme

The theme is the organizing principle of your story. It is the unifying idea of your story, the one or two word description of what your story is about on its most basic level. The theme is the question your story answers throughout its course, and it is the means by which you will convey its ideas and messages. It is absolutely essential that you select a theme, or more than one, if your story is to rise above the merely common and become truly interesting and entertaining.

Themes should pervade all aspects of your story — setting, mood, plot — but they should remain less than obvious nevertheless. Themes are more effective as subtle suggestions rather than blatant statements. Hide the theme, cache it away within the tale to be discovered as the characters interact with the story itself. Don't worry about making the theme too subtle: It will make its presence felt soon enough through the story elements you introduce to the characters.

Here are some good themes for **Masquerade** stories, as well as some thematic questions they raise during play:

Love — How does love affect our actions, thoughts and moods? What would we sacrifice for love? Can love be retrieved after it is lost? Does love endure?

Hate — How does hate manifest itself in our lives? How does the seed of hate take root, and to what acts does it drive us?

Betrayal — Why do we betray the people and things we love or that we are sworn to protect? What price does betrayal exact on our consciences and on our souls? How does it feel to be betrayed?

Revenge — Is revenge better hot or cold? How does revenge distort our perceptions and provoke our emotions?

Rebellion — What prompts us to rebel? How do we choose the targets of rebellion? Is rebellion always necessary to effect change? Can rebellion occur without violence and bloodshed?

![](_page_230_Picture_13.jpeg)

Morality — Who or what determines mortality? Who are the keepers of morals and ethics? Are these things even necessary? Are there morals that transcend individuals, cities, nations, worlds?

Chaos — Why do things tend to fall apart? Doesn't anything last? Is chaos sometimes necessary? How do we handle chaos?

mood

Mood is the general tone of the story, the underlying emotions you want your players to feel as they interact with the tale. Mood is one of the most difficult story elements to capture, and it is all the more rewarding for its elusive nature. Don't tell your players what the mood you are trying to convey is, but let them feel it in every aspect of your tale.

Think of the mood as your story's state of mind, and then ask yourself some questions about what emotions you want your story to reflect. Is the story pessimistic or hopeful? Apprehensive or confident? Angry or calm? Consider your theme and choose moods that seem to compliment it. The entire range of human emotion is available for your selection, and you need not restrict yourself to only one mood for the duration of your story. Variability of mood is especially important to remember when crafting and running longer stories, because mood can be as fluid as the plot and pacing demands.

Good moods for **Masquerade** stories:

Covetous — Everyone and everything in the story wants something. Intrigue and politics are the order of the night as the Kindred wheel and deal, scheme and plot to obtain the things they desire.

Desperate — Characters are reckless in their excitement or despair, willing to take greater risks in order to achieve some goal. No one should feel they can afford to sit back and relax as events demand drastic and extreme reactions. This mood is very appropriate to a city under siege from an enemy force, or when a dire threat proves more powerful than the characters expected.

Brooding — Everything is dark and ominous, perhaps even somber. The unexpressed dread hangs cloyingly in the air, filling everyone with a feeling of waiting for something important but unknown to happen. This mood is tough to sustain for long, but it can be very dramatic.

Mysterious — No one is what she seems, and nothing is as it appears to be. Enigmas and puzzles abound, each merely scratching the surface of the next. Characters become paranoid as they delve into layer after layer of strange revelation.

Festive — Celebration is in the air as the characters relax and let their hair down, as it were. Everyone's inhibitions are lessened by the positive atmosphere, and they feel more inclined to enjoy themselves and take new chances. This mood is a good one to invoke at the beginning of a new story, particularly when you plan to yank the rug out from under the characters' feet soon after.

Decadent — The world is decaying, falling to ruin, giving simultaneous rise to new vision and appalling debauchery. Characters must decide what path to tread as their familiar surroundings deteriorate around them.

Exciting — The action never stops as the characters contend with a never-ending cavalcade of threats, enemies and challenges. Never allow anyone to relax long enough to catch their breath. This mood is difficult to sustain, but it can give your players the roleplaying equivalent of a roller-coaster ride they will never forget.

Bitter — Everyone is angry about something and has his own ax to grind. Characters are tense and irritable, and they lash out at everyone and everything around them frequently. Individuals can progress from close friends to avowed enemies swiftly, and events that seem innocuous at first often take on savage, angry tones.

If the theme and mood are the story's heart and soul, then the plot is its body. Plot is the progression of events that takes the story from its first game session to its last, and every place in between. Your plot will be initially the result of the events you plan and introduce, but your players will also make a substantial contribution to the plot as they enact their characters' efforts to achieve their nightly and long-term goals.

Where do plots come from? Most good plots start as seeds of ideas planted in your imagination that germinate when you learn to tap your own creativity. Television, movies, magazines, novels and newspapers all provide potential plot ideas. The trick is learning to recognize the useful ideas and creating stories from them. It isn't easy at first, and sometimes it's harder than you'd like, but it's something you must teach yourself to do if you want to be a successful Storyteller.

Effective plotting means knowing your players and those things, in particular, that hold their interest. Players' attention spans vary tremendously. You will be able to amuse some players easily for months on end with little more than the story equivalent of a ball of string. Such players are the ideal recipients of long-term plot threads and subplots because they will dog them for long periods of time with remarkable determination. Other players, however, are more focused on immediate concerns, and they require a new ball of string every game session (sometimes more than once in the same session), lest they grow bored very quickly. For these players, any plot that endures beyond one or two game sessions becomes a hopeless, confusing tangle of unwanted detail. You will want to offer plots and introduce plot threads that cater to both player types, a demanding task but necessary to provide something for everyone to enjoy.

Some plots, no matter how carefully planned, won't take you where you thought you were going. The plot will become quite complicated surprisingly often, especially when characters' individual schemes clash. You will recognize this divergence when it happens by the confusion it generates. Don't panic: Confusion of this sort is both a help and a hindrance. Confusion lures and attracts those players who like to be involved in as many plots as possible. Other players react badly to confusion, and they will cease to participate when a plot gets too complex for them to unravel.

Remember, plots need not be tortuously complex to pique the interest of your players: Often the best plots are those that are simple frameworks to which you and your players can attach more complex ideas as the story proceeds. Consider these basic plot summaries and where they could lead your story:

Might Makes Right — A Kindred (a player's character or Narrator character) has seized power in the city through force. All other characters must decide how best to deal with this new regime. Should they rebel against it or begin jockeying for status and position?

To the Manor Born — Some Kindred feel they were created for the sole purpose of ruling their brethren. They exist to make themselves the leaders of their kind, by hook or by crook. Such individuals pursue power and its trappings relentlessly, creating a vortex of political machinations and social intrigue that threatens to enmesh everyone and everything in its path.

Invasion — Welcome to a city in dire peril, a city under siege. Things look black for the characters in this sort of tale: They begin the story deep in the hole and things get worse from there. The story could revolve around a Camarilla city besieged by the Sabbat, a Sabbat-held city threatened by invading archons or a location held by either sect that is facing a threat from the Lupines (see **Laws of the Wild** for details on creating Garou antagonists). This type of story caters to players who prefer their action fast and physical, offering lots of combat and violence, both planned and unplanned.

![](_page_232_Picture_9.jpeg)

The Truth Is Out There — A mysterious force, be it a vengeful or mischievous poltergeist, puzzles and bedevils the characters who must determine the nature of the supernatural entity and either come to terms with it or put it to rest. This plot is particularly good for smaller troupes, as the mystery can lose its impact quickly when shared among too many characters.

Murder Most Foul — This thread is the classic "whodunnit" scenario with a Cainite twist. The deceased is usually a figure of power or authority, such as a prince, bishop, primogen or other influential vampire, and the circumstances of her death are obscure. It's up to the characters to determine who killed her and why, and what it has to do with them. Murder plots are useful long-term backdrops for more immediate subplots.

Civil Blood — Strife and unrest are part and parcel of Cainite society, whether one glides through the sophisticated salons of the Camarilla or courts death with a Sabbat raiding party. Tensions rise as rumors of Gehenna circulate and become ever more insistent, and more than a few bold souls decide that the time to make their move is now.

setting

The setting of your story is as much a character as the fictitious individuals who populate it. Before choosing your setting, consider your theme and mood. Are there settings that will enhance or detract from them? It's difficult to convey a brooding or somber mood when your setting is a circus or a car wash.

Setting your story in familiar territory is a good option: It's fun to pretend that your home town is populated by vampires, ghouls and other creatures of the night, to imagine what your city's institutions and bureaucracy might be like if infiltrated by vampires. If you want to try this, begin by obtaining some accurate information about your city government and municipal services, and pass them through the Gothic-Punk filter. Then choose some physical locations in the area that you want to replicate in the game. The advantage to setting your story in your own backyard is that you'll have minimal research to complete before you can begin playing; the disadvantage is that your players might know your city as well as, or better than, you do.

Remember that your stories aren't restricted to familiar stomping grounds. Feel free to set the action in another city altogether. Libraries, bookstores and online sources will yield a wealth of information on nearly any municipality of any size, include population figures, government structures and handy maps. Don't even feel obligated to tell your story in the modern nights — vampires have existed for many centuries, and you can achieve some splendid effects by staging the game in the historical period of your choice. Some themes and moods that work well in a modern setting can be even more effective in other places and times. Experienced troupes often find great enjoyment in moving their story from the familiar world to one in either the distant pass or even the future. Each of these periods offer unique story opportunities: Antiquity (ancient Greece or Rome), the Dark Ages (see **The Long Night**), the Renaissance, the Victorian Age, the Wild West, the Roaring Twenties and the Cold War.

paCing

The value of pacing becomes clear when you accept, as you must, the Storyteller's axiom that nothing will go exactly as planned. Characters will sometimes miss vital clues for no apparent good reason and then spend the remainder of the evening scratching their hands as the session drags on to a helplessly late hour. Characters will also cooperate with one another in a frighteningly efficient manner from time to time, solving all the puzzles and conundrums that you thought would take them the entire night to understand. More occasionally the players

![](_page_233_Picture_9.jpeg)

![](_page_234_Picture_0.jpeg)

You can mitigate, if not avoid, these eventualities by giving due thought to your stories' pacing. Try to decide at what rate the story should progress before the game session starts. Fast-paced games throw new situations at the characters throughout the night, forcing them to deal with each new challenge as it presents itself and leaving little time for them to assess the big picture before the night is done. Slower-paced games lend themselves more to extended communications between characters, not to mention more subtle intrigues and plots. You may want to vary the tempo of a game, starting slowly and getting faster as the session progresses, or vice versa.

You can help yourself pace stories more successfully by learning to narrate spontaneously. That doesn't mean you shouldn't prepare adequately for game sessions, but rather that you should prepare yourself for the necessity of providing plot information on the fly. Characters will often ask questions for which you don't have a prepared answer, but which nevertheless deserve a response in order to keep the action flowing. Try to give answers that satisfy the characters' need for information but which will also advance with — or at least not contradict — your plot. An unexpected lull in the game's activity can be the perfect opportunity to introduce a new plot thread that you cleverly prepared for just such an occasion. Alternately, you can reintroduce a plotline that the characters thought resolved in order to keep the game session going without a break in the action.

Although off-the-cuff Storytelling is essential to any successful game, good pacing is roughly equal parts planning and improvisation. Start each night's game with at least a rough idea of the speed at which you want events to occur and where you think the story will go. Even if it doesn't get there because something unexpected happened, you'll be prepared to deal with it if you give adequate thought to pacing. Knowing the general direction in which the story is headed helps you recognize when the pace is becoming too fast or too slow, and it gives you clues about how to adjust it in ways that best suit your players and plot. You must be sensitive to the ebb and flow of the story, watching carefully for periods of too much inactivity or hopeless chaos.

Forced to choose between these extremes — too fast or too slow — opt for too fast. Stories with a pace that is too slow lead to player boredom and frustration more frequently than the former. Prepare in advance a couple of plot threads that you can introduce in case the story starts to slow unexpectedly. These threads can include elements as simple as a police patrolman stumbling on the characters' gathering place, or as complex as the unexpected appearance of a long-lost magical artifact. If you're really in doubt about what to do in order to fix the pacing, ask your players what their characters want to do next. Listen carefully to their answers and try to tailor your responses appropriately. This tactic gives you room to breathe and think, and (more importantly) it gives you a sense of why the action has fallen off.

# story Considerations

The story considerations will generally be easier for you to pin down than the key ingredients, mostly because their impact on the story is less immediate. If you do your homework and build your stories with due care, you'll find that these story elements fall into place more easily.

sCale

The scale of your story is its relative size, the number of players who want to play. You can run stories for as few as two players or as many as 200, but stories for 20 to 30 players are the most common. The scale of many stories is often

![](_page_234_Picture_9.jpeg)

predetermined by the number of players involved when you begin, but it can and will change. Players bring their friends, spouses and significant others into the game, and some players will drop out for various reasons. Such unexpected vagaries don't mean that your story's scale is at the mercy of chance — you can influence it in either direction. Actively recruiting more players will increase the scale, and getting rid of some players will decrease it. Some Storytellers establish a player cap, which is the maximum number of players they will allow to participate in any given story. The primary scale considerations should be the number of players you can comfortably handle, and the planned duration of your chronicle.

Scale can get out of hand if you are the only Storyteller and the number of players grows too rapidly or becomes too large. When you see this occurring, get some help. If you don't, your game and players will suffer as you try to handle all the Storyteller responsibilities by yourself. Ask for some volunteers from among your players and make them your Narrators. A good rule of thumb is one Narrator for every 10 players, depending on your group dynamic. Some very large games have several Storytellers, each in charge of a different aspect of the game (main plot, subplots, Influences, antagonists, etc.). Remember that the larger your scale, the more broad and encompassing your plot should be in order to allow every player the potential to become involved.

Give some special thought to scale if you are running a plot that will require many months of continuous play to complete. Spend some time thinking about how scale changes will affect your long-range plots before you start them. Sudden or dramatic changes in scale can wreak havoc on long-term plots, requiring you to do some fancy Storytelling footwork to repair the damage and keep everything on track. Stories for extended chronicles must be more flexible in order to withstand the changes in scale that will inevitably occur as some players drop out and others arrive. How will your story be affected by the sudden departure of several players midway through the tale? Can your story cope if a particular clan or sect sees unexpected growth over the course of the action, or if you gain players at a rate faster than anticipated? If the outcome of your plot hinges on only one character, think about what you will do if that character's player is suddenly obligated to leave the game, or if that character dies unexpectedly before the story's climax. Planning a few "escape routes" for your long-term plots will help you handle scale changes in stride.

sCope

Your story's scope describes the range of possibility for character action and impact — essentially, it's what is at stake in your story. Are you telling a low-key tale wherein the characters are concerned primarily with their own personal agendas? Or are you planning to give the characters the chance to save an entire city from some dire outside threat? Scale can modify your story's scope to a degree — it's easier to tell the story of an entire city of vampires if one has enough players to represent them — but in the end, the stakes can be as big or small as you want.

Shorter stories often work better with correspondingly narrower scopes, but extended chronicles can handle wide variations in scope. The key for long-range stories is balance: Vary the scope of your games from story to story to give your players variety and a sense that their characters exist in an active setting. Saving the world story after story grows tiresome, as does fighting continuously over who will be the next prince of the city, so change the value of story consequences and rewards periodically to keep things from stagnating. This need is especially strong if any of your players are involved in such long-term plots as breaking a

## player input

One of the simplest, but most often overlooked, steps you can take to prepare for a new story is to ask your players what they want. Do not underestimate the value that soliciting player feedback can have on your story's success! All too often a Storyteller conceives what he believes is a fabulous new idea for a chronicle, busies himself with many hours of detailed preparations, and presents it to his players, only to find they are not interested in that particular type of story.

Key questions to ask your players before embarking on a new Storytelling effort:

- What kind of story would you like to play in do you prefer political intrigue or combat and mayhem?
  - What sorts of plots would you like to see in the story?
- What power level should the story have should all the players be of roughly equivalent power and experience, or should they be of varying power levels?
  - What should take precedence the story, the characters or the rules?
- Should the characters be members of the Camarilla, the Sabbat, mixed sects or unaligned?

# the stages

Good stories have definitive stages — opening, climax and denouement. These points are your story's milestones, the markers which tell you where your players are in the story and what should happen to them next.

#### **Opening**

Lavish plenty of attention and detail on the opening of your story! Too many **Mind's Eye Theatre** stories start with all the characters sitting or standing around in a room, with no exploration of how they got there or why they are together. Set the time, place and conditions of the opening scene by distributing common information that every character knows before the game begins. Are the characters all present because each received an anonymous invitation? Are they gathered in an art gallery to view a new work by the Toreador primogen's latest protégé? Are they meeting to mourn the death of their pack leader and begin finding out who killed her? However sketchy, a briefing will allow your players to plunge directly into the story and begin roleplaying at once.

#### **Climax**

When the characters have discovered all they need to know to face final revelation, solve the key mystery or otherwise resolve the main plot, the story is at its climax. This is your story's high point, when the end toward which your players and their characters have been striving is in sight, and therefore the tension will be at its highest. If the opening was sufficiently intriguing and the players were enthusiastic, you need do little to help the story reach its climax. But if the players are confused or missed vital clues, you or your Narrators may find it necessary to take a more direct hand in guiding the action to its conclusion, perhaps by distributing more clues or somehow reminding characters of information they should recall. If you find that you must interfere in order to begin the climax, try to do so in such a way that does not rob the players of the joy and satisfaction of accomplishment.

#### **Denouement**

The story winds down after its climax. The excitement and tension abates, and all the story pieces (most of them, at least) come together at last to form an

![](_page_236_Picture_17.jpeg)

identifiable, coherent whole. Try to manage the resolution so that your players feel they have accomplished something, but are still interested in future stories. Just because the story is over doesn't necessarily mean the players learned all there was to learn about the main plot — sometimes just discovering another piece of the bigger puzzle gives the players sufficient motivation to continue.

You will find that your players will often want to gather immediately after the game session ends, to talk about the game and plan for future sessions. **Masquerade** players usually see only a few pieces of the story each time they play, and it's fun for them to learn more about the big picture. Players enjoy relating the night's events from their own point of view, and hearing the other players' version of events, too. You should keep one ear open at these wrap-up gatherings, both for news of exceptional roleplaying and potential plot complications.

# something For everyone

The best stories are collaborative efforts between players and Storyteller. The Storyteller provides the players with an interesting backdrop and framework, and the players build on it. You must give your players ample materials with which to do their part, however, or they will grow bored with the story rapidly. Try to make your major plots broad enough in their appeal that they will interest nearly every player in the story, perhaps by giving them a vested interest in the outcome. Even if you are able to do so for most of your players, you may find that it's difficult to shoehorn some characters into a specific plot. When that happens, try to develop a minor plot or subplot for them instead.

Some of the tools you can use to ensure that all characters get something to do are character histories and subplots.

## Blast Fromthe past

All characters in your story have pasts, which can prove an essential Storytelling aid. Encourage — no, make that insist — that your players submit character histories to you along with copies of their character sheets. These histories can be narrative descriptions of a character's past experiences, a simple timeline or any other format that defines a character's history. The character history is one of the most important tools in your Storyteller kit. All too often, a Storyteller who is fresh out of ideas for plots and subplots need look no further than these character backgrounds for the perfect story thread. Did the Sabbat pack priest have an illicit liaison with a Camarilla Kindred at some point in her history? Introduce this former lover as a Narrator character into the current story and watch the dramatic sparks fly. Does the Toreador neonate search for her sire's lost works of art? Put the missing pieces on display at a museum or in a nightclub, and let the character try to discover how they got there and how to obtain them. Character backgrounds will be lousy with ex-lovers, past misdeeds, hidden indiscretions, mortal enemies and personal quests, and they all make great subplots and plot threads.

## main plots

The central plot of your story is what brings your characters together and gives them a reason to interact. It should therefore be broad-based in its impact, affecting all characters in some way. While every character need not participate in the main plot, they should (at the very least) be aware of it and consider its potential to change their environment and circumstances.

Take, for example, a plot that concerns the slow awakening of an elder from torpor and her affect on the characters' locale. Some characters will be affected directly and immediately by the main plot as they discover and clash with the elder's

![](_page_237_Picture_10.jpeg)

minions who are scurrying about to complete preparations for her imminent return. Other characters won't be affected until the elder actually wakes from torpor and begins establishing her power base in the city. Some characters won't be affected in any direct way as they proceed with their own agendas and plans, however, they should feel the main plot's impact in some fashion as the awakening elder changes the environment and individuals around them. Occasionally a player will remain deliberately ignorant of the main plot's existence, refusing to acknowledge it even if it bites him on the rear. This player deserves no special dispensation, and he should suffer the consequences of his intentional aloofness.

## suBplots

Subplots are nearly as important to the success of your story as the main plot itself. They are minor events and activities, triumphs and tragedies, that fill the vampire's nightly existence. It isn't necessary to create a separate subplot for each player's character; often the same subplot can involve several characters simultaneously, particularly if your players are enthusiastic about the game. Strongly motivated characters will create their own subplots regularly anyway, and they will drag others into these situations without any prodding or help from you!

Some characters just won't be interested in the main plot. Their goals might be too far removed from the main story action, or their motivations might not allow them to be sidetracked by what everyone else is doing. This single focus may seem like a problem, but it's actually an opportunity. Character goals and motivations can be the very essence of great subplots, and they can lead to broader, more encompassing stories. You'll discover that subplots are also an effective means of dropping a new character into an existing story. Just give the newcomer a connection with one or more of the existing characters, and let the sparks begin to fly. Remember: Conflict is your friend! It makes for the best subplots, and it is relatively easy to establish.

When running long-term stories, be especially alert for subplots that take on a life of their own and threaten to become major plots, engulfing many characters and dominating entire game sessions. This uncontrolled expansion won't necessarily derail your own story. Look on it as an opportunity. You might even be grateful to your players on occasion for this type of enterprising behavior, because it relieves you of some of the solitary burden of creating stories. For example, it's not uncommon for at least one character in an extended chronicle to start sliding gradually toward the Beast, becoming a force of violence and chaos in the story. Though it might seem an inconvenience or a threat to your own plots, such a descent is actually a chance for some great character development and dramatic action. Work with the player to make her character's spiral into madness a thrilling story. Your plots will still be there when the other characters finish dealing with this problem.

## CharaCter relations

The game can't happen if the characters don't interact with one another. The quickest route to story failure is to create a situation in which the characters don't wish, or don't have adequate reason, to interact. Not to say that the characters must cooperate and get along all the time, of course — conflict is a vital and necessary part of good stories! Nonetheless your story will fizzle if too many characters remain completely solitary, or hoard all the information they discover. Sometimes this isolation occurs because players lack direction and are confused about what they want to do next. You can plan for this eventuality and establish good and clear reasons for characters to interact with one another.

Those character backgrounds are the ideal place to begin planning for character interaction. Were two characters in the story Embraced in London during

![](_page_238_Picture_8.jpeg)

the Victorian period? That's not only a reason for character interaction, but the makings of a subplot as well. Try fabricating rumor and gossip, or dropping hints about something suspicious happening in the vicinity that will pique character interest and coax them to interact. If this type of manipulation doesn't get them talking to one another, try giving them a common threat or enemy who is too strong for them to face individually, and who therefore requires communication and cooperation to defeat. If, despite your best efforts, the characters still refuse to interact, you may have a genuine problem: Your players may be too fearful of "losing" to risk anything by engaging in character relations (see "Troubleshooting").

# Creating the setting

The story's setting will have an immediate, tangible impact on its tone and mood, and it will influence the characters' actions from the very first game session. Your plot can be enhanced or encumbered dramatically by your choice of setting and how you detail it, so don't skimp on this element of the story.

## Finding game loCations

The ideal location for any story will have multiple rooms or areas where characters can meet privately, and a more central meeting area large enough to hold all the characters at once. It will also need to be relatively private, so that your players won't disturb anyone and will not be disturbed in turn. Examples of good story locations are parks, dorm lounges, apartment complex lounges, museums, restaurant meeting rooms, office board rooms, night clubs, conventions and shopping malls. The more public the location, however, the more care you must take not to disturb or offend non-players with your choice of costumes, props, language and behavior.

Obtain permission before utilizing any type of private property, and maintain contact with local law enforcement authorities if your story will occur in view of the public eye. Use good judgment when dealing with any non-players who approach your game and are curious about what is going on; take the time to explain exactly what you are doing, but don't invite non-players to participate in the game at this point. Consider printing up some inexpensive business cards to offer passersby who are genuinely curious and encourage them to contact you later, when you can speak with them at leisure.

## where are we?

Take some time to think about what the setting must be like from your characters' point of view. What's its history? What are its secrets? Who are the major movers and shakers in the area? Are there supernatural threats waiting to pounce on your unsuspecting characters? Is it a threatening place where the characters will face danger every night, or is it a peaceful, placid locale in which the characters are the ultimate power? Choose locations that complement your theme and mood whenever possible. If you want to invoke a brooding, somber mood as you weave a tale about the price of power, you shouldn't choose the front room of a pizza parlor, no matter how inexpensive or centrally located it might be. After choosing your location, supply your characters with a general map of the location, whether it's an entire city or a single building within a metropolis. Doing so gives them a better idea of the physical location and helps them visualize the setting as they play.

## disasters waiting to happen

A very useful Storytelling technique is to plant a few incendiary devices within the story backdrop before the story even begins. These story "land mines" go off only if characters meet predetermined criteria known only to you. For example, you decide when you create the story that the local FBI field office is supervised by an agent who

![](_page_239_Picture_10.jpeg)
