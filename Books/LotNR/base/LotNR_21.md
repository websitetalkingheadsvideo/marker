## stage Business

in and out oF the Box

Devote time and attention to your setting and the stage on which it occurs. Your story's setting should not be a cardboard stage that exists only when your players tread on it. Make it a vibrant, active part of the story that lives and breathes even without the characters' conscious presence.

Think about what happens during any given 24-hour period in any community. People are born and die, they transact business, they obtain goods and services, they construct new buildings and tear old ones down, they commit crimes and infidelities, they end relationships and begin new ones and they embark on hundreds of minor projects and enterprises that, when combined, make up their daily and nightly lives. What happens in your setting when the characters depart the Elysium for the night? How might these events be reflected on your stage when the characters next meet? Your setting should reflect this ebb and flow of mortal life, so that your characters will know and understand that they live in a place that is not static, but that is as active as they are.

### amBianCe

This game is about vampires. These creatures dwell in a world remarkably like our own, but with subtle differences. This world is the epitome of the Gothic-Punk environment, and establishing its look and feel in your game can be a challenge. Lighting, music and stage dressing will all help bring your story and scenes to life and make it all the more real for your players.

### lighting

The world of the Cainites is dim, full of shadowed rooms, dark corners and unlit alleys. Vampires can function only during the hours of darkness. Increase the realism and believability of your setting by avoiding daylight games. Drawing aside a curtain to reveal the bright sun of high noon can be hell on game ambiance. Turn out some of the lights in your game locations, but don't make the room pitch black — doing so risks the safety of the participants. Candles are ideal for creating the proper ambiance, but most game sites won't permit real fire, with good reason. You can replicate firelight with electric holiday candles, or regular light bulbs masked by colored plastic screens (called gels). Strings of miniature lights can also replicate shadowy spaces, but give you enough light to play safely.

Avoid bright, direct lighting, as it brings the mundane world into sharp focus. Try replacing white lights with lower wattage, softer bulbs. You can even use multicolored lights to help create mood and atmosphere. A red light bathing one corner of a room helps convey an angry, tense mood, while blue light often indicates cooler, more subdued emotions. Strobe lights and black lights both work well to convey the energy and appearance of a nightclub, while phosphorescent glow sticks make great light sources for sewers (and the red ones give off a glow that's reminiscent of firelight). If you can't turn off some of the lights or replace them with dimmer bulbs, try draping a screen of dark cloth over them to cut down the direct light, being careful not to create a fire hazard.

Consider the emotional messages you want to send with each story session. Music can help you create these feelings, underscoring the sensations of fear, anger, love or joy that you're trying to bring into the game. Bring a variety of music to your games so that you can change it to reflect your story's changing moods, and tailor the music volume to the current story environment. Keep the volume at a background level when your players are trying to interact — don't force them to compete with the music. Try not to let the music overpower your settings. Your choice of music should suggest the mood, not dictate it. Movie soundtracks are ideal for many stories because they have few distracting lyrics and usually have multiple tracks that convey the changing moods and scenes of the film. Try classical music or light jazz to evoke a more sophisticated atmosphere, or techno and dance to establish a higher energy level. Gregorian chants and plainsong create a feeling of antiquity, while New Age music can evoke a mysterious atmosphere.

### props

Consider props as one of your final touches. They are one of the last details needed to make your story believable, and they fall into two categories: stage props and personal props.

#### **Stage Props**

Stage props are those pieces of set dressing that decorate your game location to suggest the fictional locale where the story takes place. Whether set in the chantry or the sewers, you need some props to help bring the game to life. Good story props include furniture, works of art (especially art created by your players), costume jewelry, old clothes, legal documents, electronic bits and pieces from appliances that no longer function, scrolls, pieces of old Halloween costumes and unidentifiable oddments from your basement and attic. The limitations on props include resources, space, portability and storage.

You don't need to spend a fortune on props. You'll find many excellent pieces of set dressing in your own home, in discount or second-hand shops, and you can make others easily. They needn't be lavish — props shouldn't compete with your story for the players' attention. Props that *suggest* an object or setting are more than adequate in conveying the general idea of the actual object. Good players will treat these things as the genuine objects while in character, and they will use their imaginations to fill in the blanks. For example, a single large chair set in the center of an empty room can be the Prince's throne and represent his court; it needs only your descriptive narration to provide the necessary imagery. If your game seems short on stage props, enlist the help of your players in finding some suitable pieces, or get together and build a few simple props together.

Make sure your stage props are appropriate to the space in which you will use them. A great-looking wooden chest will be lost if you stick in the far corner of a school auditorium. Likewise a massive oak table and its 10 chairs might be just the thing for meetings of the city primogen, but it's less useful if it leaves no playing room for other characters. Smaller props might require some special lighting to make them noticeable among the other elements of your game, while larger props will tend to dominate scenes and even overpower them if they are too large.

Props small and large don't just find their way to the game site by themselves. Before you invest in any huge or awkward stage props, consider how you will get them from their storage place to the game and back. Smaller props can present the same problem if you have many boxes of them or if some of them are fragile. Check with the owners of your game site about prop storage. You might be able

![](_page_242_Picture_0.jpeg)

#### **Personal Props**

More than costumes, personal props help identify particular characters or Narrator characters. Hats, canes, gloves, scarves, old medals, cloaks, briefcases, stethoscopes, riding crops, lab coats and jewelry all help give characters a distinctive appearance. The number one rule about personal props is: They must be safe. Never allow a player or Narrator to carry anything that might injure another person, and never permit any real or prop weapons in the game. Doing so is an invitation to disaster, and it is the hallmark of a foolish and immature Storyteller.

Economy is often a primary consideration in securing personal props. Many people just don't have the resources to spend on lavish costumes and brand new accessories they will use only for their games. Lead your players on a props scavenger hunt around your community, hitting discount stores, second-hand and consignment shops, yard and garage sales, and antique stores. The hunt for good personal props is continuous — most consignment and resale shops change their stock frequently, so make them a regular stop in your prop search.

so you want to tell a story… You've got some players, a place to play, a plot and a collection of great CDs — you're ready to play, right? Nope. Here's a checklist of important things you'll have to work out before the game even starts:

### Bookkeeping

You will want to keep a careful, exact record of certain things throughout the course of your story. You will be tempted to blow off the bookkeeping, but don't. Part of the fun for players is watching their characters grow and change over time. They will want to know how many Experience Traits they have, how close they are to gaining a new Ability Trait, and whether their latest Influence actions have borne fruit yet. A good Storyteller should be able to answer these questions with a minimum of fuss, but you won't be able to if you don't keep accurate records. If the scale of your story is too large for you to keep all the records easily by yourself, it's time to get some organizational help (see "Narrators").

If you have regular access to a computer or word processor, take advantage of some of the terrific record-keeping and contact management software available today. You can maintain one spreadsheet page for each player, or combine them all into one sheet for easy comparisons. Resist the temptation to maintain this database in electronic format only — if your hard drive ever crashes, you'll be very happy you kept paper copies in your notebook!

### CharaCter sheets

Maintain a hard copy of each player's character sheet, even if you're using a personal computer for most of your record-keeping and maintenance. Insist that every player turn in a copy of her character sheet to you before participating in a single game, even if it means that she sits out the first hour of the game to copy out a character sheet for you by hand. Keep this original copy in your files and make

![](_page_242_Picture_11.jpeg)

certain you update it as the story progresses. Develop the habit of reviewing all the character sheets regularly, perhaps a day or two before each game, to be certain that you didn't forget to add or note something. Track Experience Trait awards and expenditures on the sheet, as well as new Traits, Disciplines or any other changes. Keep these hard copies organized, and bring them to each game session. Establish a policy at your very first game that if there is ever any dispute about anything appearing on a player's character sheet, the Storyteller's copy takes precedence.

### experienCe

Take a look at the Experience chart on p. 124, and decide how you will award Experience before launching your story. Advise each player of her award as soon as possible following every game, and note the award on your copy of the player's character sheet. Be fair when awarding Experience: You want to satisfy your players without destroying game balance. Awarding too much Experience will lead to characters who reach their maximum potential too quickly; awarding too few will result in player frustration and dissatisfaction.

Every player should earn at least one Experience Trait automatically for participating in a game session. Award an extra Trait to those players who roleplayed exceptionally well (but be sure to set the bar higher in subsequent games to prevent players from resting on their roleplaying laurels). Beyond that, consider awarding an extra Experience Trait on the basis of character achievement to encourage your players to be more active during game sessions. Encourage players to list their character goals in their backgrounds, or to provide you with a goal list before a game begins. If multiple characters contribute to achieving a group goal (like a Sabbat pack ousting a Camarilla prince from the city), give all the players involved in achieving the goal the extra Experience Trait.

### inFluenCe traits

If you permit your players to use their Influence Traits during downtimes (see "Downtimes"), you must keep very careful track of what each Trait is doing at all times. Otherwise, it is inevitable that two characters' Influence Traits will clash as they attempt to complete opposing tasks — you will need to know when this eventuality occurs to aid you in narrating the resulting fireworks. If you are the Storyteller for a large group, say more than 15 players, consider giving control of the Influence Trait portion of the story to a Narrator; otherwise you may find yourself swamped with requests for Influence Trait activities between games.

### story events

Keep a log or journal of how the story is going. After each game, find some time to jot down a few notes about what happened. Reviewing these notes will help you prepare for the next game session and evaluate how the story is progressing. Don't hesitate to ask individual players what their characters saw, heard and did at each game; better yet, ask them to provide you with some kind of post-game statement or note detailing the game session from their characters' point of view.

## CharaCter Creation

Work as closely as possible with your players during character creation. The time you invest now in helping your players create interesting, vivid characters will repay you tenfold when the game is actually under way. Much has been written about the value of building strong motivations into player characters, and this is your chance to remind players of this necessity once again! Characters must have clear motivations, plans, hopes, dreams and goals, or they are little more than a dry collection of statistics on equally dry paper.

![](_page_243_Picture_10.jpeg)

Some Storytellers like to meet with each player individually, but busy schedules and large troupes can sometimes make doing so impossible. Try holding a group brainstorming session to generate good, strong character concepts, talk about shared character histories and get a general feel of the sorts of stories to which these characters are best suited. Be clear about what you will and will not allow in your story. If you intend to change any of the rules in this book — and it's perfectly natural and acceptable if you choose to do so — inform your players as they are thinking about their character concepts, so that they do not inadvertently create characters that will be unplayable in your story.

Some troupes, particularly large ones, may have the luxury of several Narrators who can help players make characters and forward the paperwork to the Storyteller. This method works well as a time-saver for exceptionally busy Storytellers. However, if you decide to allow Narrators to supervise character creation, be certain to provide them with any special rules or methods you wish observed.

Regardless of the character creation method you employ, take ample time to review the character sheets before the first game session starts. Look for mistakes and errors that will complicate play later, such as a character with too many Attribute Traits for her generation. Acquaint yourself with the histories and backgrounds for each of your player characters. Make a genuine attempt to understand what makes each character tick, and if you don't understand, ask the player to help you grasp what he's trying to convey. If you don't understand why a character has a particular item in her background, ask the player to account for it before play begins.

Once the story commences, your concern should turn from character creation to character development. Encourage your players to keep records, diaries or journals written from their characters' point of view as a roleplaying exercise. Talk with players about their characters from time to time to get a sense of how they perceive the characters' actions within the context of the story, and how they think the characters are developing.

### An Evening's Events

#### Вегове тне Даме

Abandon any hope of accomplishing anything not game-related in the hours before the session actually starts. You'll be too busy making final adjustments to the night's plots and subplots, reviewing character sheets, packing up props and answering last-minute player questions. No matter how hectic or busy these hours might be, however, don't fail to take a few moments to relax and prepare yourself mentally for the game. If possible, meet with your Narrators and make certain they know about any special expectations or goals you have for the evening.

#### Pre-Game Setup

Be one of the first people to arrive at the game site. Establish yourself in a convenient table, chair or corner and tell your players when you think you'll be ready to get the game underway. Check out the game site — is everything as it should be? Unpack and set up your props, enlisting help from your players if necessary. Set aside some time to check in your players before the game starts — many of them will want to talk with you briefly and ask questions. Have your copies of character sheets handy. Check all props for safety, remembering that no real weapons of any kind are allowed in the game, ever.

#### GAME ON

Give your players a minute or two to collect themselves and get "into character." Advise them that they should remain in character henceforth unless

![](_page_244_Picture_11.jpeg)

they have a question for the Storyteller or a Narrator. If the size of your game location permits, designate an area as the "reality room" where players can take a short break if needed, dropping out of character and remaining out for as long as they are in that area. Then, when all questions are answered and you are ready, inform the players how long you expect the game session will last, dim the lights and announce the start of the game.

## during the game

If you aren't actively portraying a character or answering a player's question, you might be a little uncertain what to do with yourself while the game is on. How you occupy yourself during a session depends more on your Storytelling style than anything else. Some Storytellers like to hole up in a corner with a notebook and watch the action, jotting down interesting occurrences and watching for problems. Others like to remain at their check-in area so that players can find them easily. Be prepared to answer questions, adjudicate challenges and resolve plot complications at any moment.

## aFter the game

It's a good idea to get your players together before they leave the game for some "decompression." Live-action roleplaying can be an energetic and intense experience. Give your players a little nudge back toward reality once the game is over. Encourage feedback from your players. What were their favorite and least favorite moments in the game? Did everyone enjoy themselves? If not, why not? Did anyone feel lost or confused? Are there any questions about the night's events (be careful not to give too much of the plot away when answering this one)? Make any necessary announcements at this point.

Police the game site and clean it. If the location belongs to someone else, leave it in better condition than you found it. Pack up your props and make sure everyone else does the same. Be one of the last people to leave, and give the site a last once-over to ensure that nothing was left behind or is out of place.

Many playing groups enjoy going out for refreshments after a game session, and that's a great way to relax and unwind at the end of the night. Don't feel obligated to continue Storytelling once the game session concludes, however. A player might not be able to enjoy his onion rings until you tell him how many Experience Traits he earned tonight, but it's important to encourage players to have the proper perspective about the game.

## taking Care oF players

Some players will, for lack of a more polite word, obsess about your story and the game. They will spend the bulk of their free time thinking and talking about it, and they will pester you incessantly with more questions about the plots, subplots, characters and clues. This extreme behavior can be both annoying and frustrating, but try to see the unspoken compliment these players are paying you: They are so entertained by your efforts that it's their pastime of choice — no small feat in a world in which people enjoy many thousands of entertainments.

Encourage all your players to pursue their goals actively. It is not sufficient for a player to decide that she wants her character to become the prince — she must actively pursue this course of action during the course of the story. Encourage her to ask herself, before each game session begins, how her character can travel further down the path toward her goal tonight. The character who wishes to become the prince, for example, should plan to meet and speak with as many different characters as possible during the evening, in order to maintain a high

![](_page_245_Picture_10.jpeg)

degree of visibility in the city. If she pursues her character goal actively during each game, she will eventually gain supporters who will become advocates for her ascension to the princedom (wittingly or otherwise).

Remember, while dispensing these snippets of advice and fielding dozens of zealous questions, to respect your players. Without them, there is no story! This doesn't mean you should allow your players to run your life or run amok without consequences. Showing respect does mean that you should listen attentively when they ask questions, value their opinions and strive to give them the best story you can. Meanwhile, keep an eye out for players whose characters come into conflict with one another during the course of the story. These players will sometimes tend to allow these inter-character conflicts to spill over into tension and hostility between themselves. If this happens, don't hesitate to remind the players that they must learn to distinguish between the events that occur in the story and their own, genuine emotions. Such conflicts can, if ignored, become serious problems and damage your story.

### new players

Coming into a new situation is always nerve-wracking. Now imagine that you're going into a new place, meeting a group of strangers, yet you aren't even yourself! That's what every new player is staring at when they make the giant step into roleplaying. These new players may become your veterans eventually, so it's important to give them some attention.

Occasionally, new players will forget what they should be doing, and they may drop out of character at inappropriate times or break a conduct rule. Your best option is to remind them politely to stay in character or behave themselves, as it is a courtesy for others who are trying to play around them. Point them to the reality room if they need a break or have questions.

If the new person has never roleplayed before, pitching them out into the game with only a smattering of rules and their character sheet is frankly a little cruel. Sometimes these folks come in with friends, spouses or significant others, so they aren't completely friendless or lost, but occasionally, the lone new person does come in, trying out something for the first time. Consider sending these folks in bearing plot clues for certain individuals, letters for characters or something that gives them a reason to get close to the other players. Some go-getters can plunge right into action without a moment's hesitation, but the shy and the inexperienced may need some extra help. If your chronicle has primogen who take an active hand in their clans, encourage those players to watch out for the very new folks.

Some older players exhibit a disturbing tendency to view new players as "fresh meat." There are few surer ways to drive off new players to your game than by letting the predators have their way. Keep an eye out for bullying, rules lawyering or the like against new players, and step in if you see someone getting dog-piled. Most new players are often shy about approaching a Storyteller, fearing that their word won't be taken seriously because they are not part of the "in" crowd. If someone does come to you with a complaint, listen to the grievance and investigate it seriously. Taking it lightly only reinforces the player's perception that his word is valueless.

In the end, your best bet with new players is to give them plenty of patience and be prepared to give them some extra help as they muddle through the first games. You will be rewarded with seeing someone develop confidence in her roleplaying and taking on an active role without needing encouragement, and that means another strong veteran player you can count on.

![](_page_246_Picture_8.jpeg)

![](_page_247_Picture_0.jpeg)

You can't be everywhere during a game session. Sooner or later you will realize that something critical to the story occurred and you weren't even aware of it until a week later! Sometimes you will actually be the last person to know about a significant event that happened at a game. Likewise, you can't do everything yourself, especially if your story scale is growing. Unless you have an exceptionally small group of players, you're going to need some Narrators.

Stories can have unlimited numbers of Narrators. A good rule of thumb is to enlist one Narrator for every 10 players, but you can adjust this ratio to suit the circumstances of your game. A very intricate or volatile plot may require more Narrators than one that is relatively straightforward or linear. The more Narrators you have, the more work you can delegate, and the more you can concentrate on Storytelling. Encourage players to go to Narrators with their questions first, especially those concerning rules adjudication. There is no reason you must handle every challenge personally if you have Narrators who do so competently.

One of the most valuable and essential Narrator tasks is adjudicating rules questions. Therefore Narrators should be very familiar with all the necessary rules. You'll have to evaluate your Narrators and decide whether they should answer player questions related to the plot. If you want your Narrators to provide players with plot information, be sure to brief them thoroughly and establish the boundaries of what information they can impart and what should remain hidden. Give them clear expectations and good directions before each game starts.

Encourage your Narrators to ask for help if they are in over their heads, and don't hesitate to step in if a situation appears to be getting out of hand. Don't overrule a Narrator in public if you can avoid it, however, because doing so undermines her authority and causes embarrassment. Encouraging clear communication between your Narrators and yourself can help avoid such situations.

Narrators can help new players create characters, handle Experience Trait expenditures and help keep track of the story's paperwork. Some particularly large games utilize separate Narrators to handle individual aspects of the story — one Narrator for Kindred characters, another for ghouls and mortals, still another for Influences, perhaps one more for antagonists, as well. Each Narrator is then responsible for managing that story element, and he should do so with the goal of making less work for the Storyteller.

# downtimes:

# the games-Between-games

"Downtime" is the inclusive phrase to indicate not only the period between game sessions, but also any player's character's activities, actions and exchanges that occur during this time. If you weren't aware of this fact already, your players will make you aware of it approximately two minutes after the game concludes for the night. The end of the game session isn't necessarily the end of the action. Most **Masquerade** stories do not remain in limbo between game sessions — the characters still exist in the context of the story, even if they aren't all meeting in the same place at the same time. Naturally, your players will wish their characters to undertake a variety of activities between games.

The most inconvenient aspect of downtime or "off-line" gaming is that you cannot be present to personally adjudicate every activity. The best means of

![](_page_247_Picture_10.jpeg)

![](_page_248_Picture_0.jpeg)

Good downtime information includes:

- Hunting behavior In what part of the city does the character normally hunt? Does she favor a particular type of vessel over others? How does she normally approach vessels? Does she kill them or merely take what she needs?
- Influence Traits The player should outline exactly what she is trying to accomplish and how, note which Influence Traits are involved and what contingency plans she's made in case her attempts fail or backfire. Consider the impact of these activities on your story before replying!
- Meetings Who does the character meet with, when and why? What is discussed?
- Disciplines If the character is trying to learn a new Discipline power, who is teaching him?

If you have access to a personal computer and have the skills, you may find it useful to create a Web page which offers your players a ready-made downtime form which they can complete and submit online.

HANDLING PLAYER QUESTIONS

There will be times during which you must engage a player in a discussion that obliges her to drop out of character. It's unavoidable, but try to keep such interactions as brief as possible. Avoid protracted discussions or arguments about the rules; save them for after the game. If you must interpret a complex situation that threatens to seriously retard the pace of the game, make your ruling as quickly as possible and deal with any consequences later.

Often one of the most distracting questions comes from players who arrive to the game substantially after the designated starting time. These players may have excellent excuses or they may simply be inconsiderate, but regardless you must decide how to handle the intrusion. One method is to force these players to jump right into play immediately without benefit of conferring with a Story-teller — this penalizes their tardiness by giving them no opportunity to spend Experience Traits or clear new equipment cards before plunging into the action. Another method is to oblige these players to wait, not taking part in the game, until you have the time and opportunity to deal with their tardy arrival.

Troubleshooting

PLAYER BOREDOM: "THERE'S NOTHING TO DO IN THIS GAME!"

You will hear this refrain at some point during your tenure as a Storyteller. If you choose your players wisely and prepare your stories adequately, you won't hear it too often, but when you do, don't panic. Remember: The responsibility and burden of creating and maintaining interest in the story does not fall *entirely* on your shoulders, however broad they may be. Your players have some responsibilities, too. When you hear these complaints of boredom, try to help the player identify the source of the problem:

- Is the player pursing her goals actively?
- Is the player hoarding information she should be sharing?
- Is the player refusing to interact with other players during games?

![](_page_248_Picture_16.jpeg)

![](_page_249_Picture_0.jpeg)

- Did the player create a full character background?
- Is the pace of the game too slow for the player?
- Is the player achieving her character goals too easily?
- Is there something in particular the player dislikes or doesn't understand about the story?

Paradoxically, you might hear cries of boredom even when you go out of your way to provide the allegedly bored players with a clear course of activity! In such cases the problem almost always lies with the players' perception of the story rather than in any deficiencies in your Storytelling. Nonetheless, some players will claim to be bored and they will have a legitimate complaint. Prepare several plot threads you can introduce into the story quickly, but that do not invalidate the plots and subplots already in progress.

The more players that participate in your story, the more likely it is that one or more of them will eventually claim to be bored. The player may be bored because she's not pursuing her character's goals actively or worse, doesn't have any character goals. If you think such is the case, remind the player that the easiest way for her to exclude herself from the story and grow bored is to remain inactive and silent during a game session. Characters who do not interact with other characters or who do not make an effort to participate in the action will be forgotten quickly by their peers. While some players may be shy or may prefer to participate more passively, suggest that they locate at least one other character with whom to interact — otherwise, they probably won't enjoy the game, and there's probably little you can do to alleviate their boredom.

too muCh violenCe: "not anothermass ComBat!"

Conflict is endemic to the Cainite world, and sometimes conflict will lead to violence. It's a part of the game, but it need not be the focus of each and every story. If you believe your story is plagued by unnecessary or ceaseless violence, talk with the players you believe are responsible. Do they truly believe they are roleplaying their characters' Natures and Demeanors appropriately, or are they using that as an excuse to kick the snot out of everything that moves? If every session devolves into a mob scene combat or extended series of Physical Challenges, you probably do have a problem.

Try moving the fictional location of the game to a place where the characters must think twice about going berserk, such as an art gallery, museum, shopping mall or the Elysium. If the extreme or unwarranted violence continues to be a problem despite your best efforts, the players and their characters must pay the piper for their behavior. Perhaps the prince and his entourage must make an appearance to put things right, or maybe a character will break the Masquerade by relying on his fists to solve every problem, leading to dire but well-deserved consequences.

If you believe the source of the excessive bloodletting is a particular player who seems to enjoy the game only if he's attacking or killing other characters, don't let this person ruin the game for everyone else. Deal with him calmly but firmly, informing him that if he can't rein in his behavior you must ask him to leave the game. If he can't handle such a stricture, get rid of him and don't look back.

metagaming: "hey, your CharaCter Can't possiBly knowthat!"

If your players seem confused about the differences between what occurs in character and out of character, advise them to adopt a means of determining when a conversation or other communication is occurring outside the context of the game. Suggest that the players remain in character at all times for the
