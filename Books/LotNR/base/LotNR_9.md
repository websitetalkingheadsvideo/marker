medium (2 trait merit)

The voices of the dead sometimes come across the Shroud to haunt you. Ghosts flock to give you messages for the living world, and you can sense their presence in a room without using any special powers. Although you cannot normally see wraiths, you can always hear them, and you can communicate with them for favors or information. Of course, the Restless Dead always want *something* in return.

luCky (3 trait merit)

You were born lucky — or the Devil looks after his own. Either way, you get three retests per story (for which you bid a *Lucky* Trait: "I got *Lucky* — you missed me last time."), though you may not use more than one retest on any challenge.

oraCular aBility (3 trait merit)

The signs and portents of everyday life are clear to you, offering up the course of the future. Once per session, you may attempt to read a particular omen by making a Static Mental Challenge with a difficulty of eight or more Traits (Narrator's discretion). If you succeed, you receive some insight into the current situation, allowing you to claim one retest at some point during the night as you draw on the visions that you interpreted.

spirit mentor (3 trait merit)

A ghostly companion and guide follows you about, exercising its powers on your behalf. Maybe it's a deceased lover or friend, or maybe it's just curious about you. Its exact powers are up to the Storyteller (it's recommended that you build a basic wraith with the **Oblivion** rulebook to represent this character). If it really exerts itself, it can sometimes affect the material world. More often, it provides advice and company.

unBondaBle (3 trait merit)

The blood bond cannot take hold on you. No matter how much blood you drink, you will never be bound, even partially.

true love (4 trait merit)

You have found (and perhaps lost) a *True Love*, a piece of comfort and companionship in an otherwise despairing world. When confronted by adversity, the thought of your *True Love* provides strength and peace of mind. You effectively gain one extra Willpower Trait each session, spent as a *True Love* Trait. (These Traits are not cumulative; you cannot save them up.) However, your *True Love* may require rescuing or assistance from time to time.

nine lives (6 trait merit)

You have nine chances to cheat death. Your Storyteller should keep a tally of your lives (you can also mark them on your character sheet). Any time that a lost challenge would result in your death, you get a retest. You can keep retesting, even on the same challenge, until you survive or until you use up all of your *Nine Lives*.

true Faith (7 trait merit)

The light of God, Allah, Buddha or whatever name you use for the Almighty shines from your soul. You have one Trait of True Faith, which can be used in a variety of ways. You can use your Faith Trait as a Willpower Trait. You can also repel other vampires with a Social Challenge, saying, "In the name of \_\_\_\_\_" and brandishing a holy symbol. If you win the Social Challenge, the other vampire flees, and even if you lose, the opponent cannot approach closer than 10 feet of you unless he overbids you in a test of Willpower against Willpower. You must maintain a Morality of five Humanity Traits to keep this Merit. This Merit is exceedingly rare among the Damned, and the Storyteller will demand a *very* good explanation from you. See **Laws of the Hunt** for more ideas about *True Faith*.

Cursed (1 to 5 trait Flaw)

A powerful curse — other than vampirism — afflicts you. The number of Traits in this Flaw determines the power and tenacity of the curse. A one-Trait curse

![](_page_120_Picture_18.jpeg)

might cause you to stumble whenever you cross a doorstep; a three-Trait curse could cause any weapon you use to break after one strike; a five-Trait curse may result in all your best efforts being eventually turned against you. The exact particulars of the curse, as well as any way to overcome it, are up to the Storyteller.

Cast no reFleCtion (1 trait Flaw)

Like the Lasombra, you cast no reflection in mirrors or silvered surfaces. Obviously, this Flaw constitutes a breach of the Masquerade, and it can draw a great deal of attention in certain circumstances. Lasombra cannot take this Flaw for free Traits.

repulsed By garliC (1 trait Flaw)

Even the smallest whiff of garlic is sufficient to send you from the room. When you are confronted with a bit of garlic, you must expend a Willpower Trait or else be forced at least 10 feet away. If you spend the Willpower, you are able to abide the stench for one scene.

touCh oF Frost (1 trait Flaw)

Your chilling caress pulls away heat and kills plants. This Flaw is mostly an eerie effect, though you should certainly mention your ice-cold touch to anyone who has physical contact with you.

eerie presenCe (2 trait Flaw)

You radiate an otherworldly air that causes nervousness and unease in everyone around you. You suffer a two-Trait penalty in all Social Challenges with mortals. Furthermore, your unusual nature is apparent to anyone who interacts with you; you should wear a tag or armband to indicate your *Eerie Presence*.

Can't Cross running water (3 trait Flaw)

As per the old folk tales, you believe that you cannot cross running water, and indeed, something prevents you from doing so. You must be at least 50 feet above a body of water to cross it. Running water is considered to be any body of water at least two feet wide in any direction and not completely stagnant and enclosed (thus, sewer lines under the street don't count).

haunted (3 trait Flaw)

A malicious ghost, possibly of one of your victims, has decided to torment you from beyond the grave. Though it usually limits itself to phantasmal moaning, eerie manifestations and the occasional push, it does its best to make your unlife difficult. The Storyteller should make up the spirit, and possibly assign a Narrator to follow you and make sure that you pay for the Flaw. (Use of **Oblivion** is highly recommended.)

repelled By Crosses (3 trait Flaw)

You may have some residual religious guilt, or perhaps you take vampire legends too seriously. Whatever the reason, the sight of the cross causes you to flee unless you expend a Willpower Trait (in which case you can resist it for the rest of the scene). If you are struck by a cross on your bare skin, you take one level of aggravated damage for each blow, and you cannot reduce this damage with *Fortitude*. (This Flaw pertains to the actual religious symbol, not two crossed popsicle sticks or whatever else.)

grip oF the damned (4 trait Flaw)

There is no ecstasy in your Embrace — only terror and pain. When you bite to feed, you do not cause the Kiss, so your victims scream and struggle. This Flaw necessitates some method of restraining your prey. The torture that you inflict on your victims can be considered a form of suffering, and it may be inimical to vampires with high Humanity Traits.

dark Fate (5 trait Flaw)

Some horrible end awaits you, and you cannot avert it. Worse still, you have glimpses or some foreknowledge of your demise or eternal torment. The Storyteller will determine a particular fate, which will invariably strike you, removing your

![](_page_121_Picture_19.jpeg)

character from play. Furthermore, in any particular session where the Storyteller deems appropriate, you may receive a vision of your impending misery. You must spend a Willpower Trait to shake off the experience, or you are a Trait down on all challenges for the rest of the session. This Flaw can be difficult to roleplay, and players are advised to think carefully before choosing it. Some may believe that this Flaw removes free will, but foreknowledge of one's demise can be quite liberating.

light-sensitive (5 trait Flaw)

You are even more vulnerable to light than most vampires. Sunlight inflicts double damage, and even moonlight hurts — direct moonlight causes one level of lethal damage per turn. You must use sunglasses to shield your eyes, and you tend to stick to dark places out of habit and safety.

# experienCe

As sentient beings, we collate the information that is presented to us in our daily lives and hopefully become better people for our experiences. During our life, we learn from the mistakes of yesterday and prepare for the challenges of tomorrow.

Experience in **Laws of the Night** is represented by giving each character one to three Experience Traits at the end of each session. The number of Traits awarded is based on how well a character performed during the course of the story and how active a player was in the game. The Narrator decides how many Traits each player receives on completion of the session. All players receive one Trait — this is standard. Exceptional roleplayers, those who played an exceptionally memorable part, should receive two. Three Traits should be awarded to those characters who performed acts of incredible insight and courage, making the game truly memorable for everyone involved. On a normal night, each player will receive one Experience Trait.

If you are a Narrator, you should be consistent and fair in awarding Experience. Do it in the open, and be prepared to explain the rationale for your decisions in accordance with the rules. If the players disagree, hear them out and make sure you know the whole story, then award Experience to those who have earned it.

Be careful, as awarding too many Experience Traits can make characters too powerful too quickly and give players lax attitudes toward working for their goals. On the other hand, awarding too few disheartens the players and damages their sense of achievement.

Awarding Experience Traits, therefore, requires a delicate balance between satisfying players and maintaining the integrity of the game. If you follow the guidelines listed here, you probably won't get into too much trouble.

- **Automatic**  Each character receives one Experience Trait per game, representing the acquisition of common, everyday knowledge.
- **Roleplaying**  Narrators should encourage roleplaying. The best way to do so is to reward it tangibly with Experience.
- **Leadership** You should award one Trait to each of those few players who had starring parts in a story. Someone who got involved, and by her efforts propelled the plot, deserves a third Trait. It should be noted that if more than one of the players were integral to the progression of the story, each of the players who showed such leadership should be awarded a Trait.

using experienCe

Experience Traits may be spent to purchase new Abilities, Traits and Disciplines, improving a character and giving the player a sense of satisfaction as he watches his character grow more potent. The on p.124 chart lists the costs for improving Traits, Abilities and Disciplines.

### CONVERTING CHARACTERS FROM DREVIOUS EDITIONS

Players of the previous version of **Laws of the Night** can easily convert characters built on those rules to the updated rules of the Final Nights. Simply follow the character creation outline, using the conversions listed here.

#### Converting Concept, Clan,

#### Morality, Nature and Demeanor

Your character's concept probably remains unchanged as a result of the rules – your background story is not affected by the vagaries of Traits.

Similarly, clans remain largely unchanged. The Gangrel may have left the Camarilla en masse, but individuals still choose their own allegiances. Some bloodlines have changed their Disciplines — most notably, the Samedi now have Fortitude instead of Necromancy. Samedi characters should simply be charged extra Experience for their levels of Necromancy, appropriate to the difference in cost; they can then purchase Fortitude as desired. Older characters are considered to be "typical" of their clans, and thus, they may not swap out to become one of a bloodline. Malkavians can swap their Dominate for Dementation, as explained under the Dementation Discipline on p. 145.

A character's Morality is still the same Humanity or Path of Enlightenment, but Beast/Path Traits are no longer used. Instead, the character has five Morality Traits, minus one Trait for each Beast/Path Trait. Thus, a character with two Beast Traits now has a Humanity of three Traits.

Natures and Demeanors follow the Archetypes listed here, though there is certainly nothing to prevent the use of previously published Archetypes.

#### Updating Clan

Note specifically that the clan advantages and disadvantages for this edition of **Laws of the Night** differ from the predecessors, which may grant certain characters extra Traits or penalties.

#### Converting Attributes

For the most part, Attributes remain unchanged. The number of Traits possessed by a character stays the same, and most of the adjectives are the same, too. The sole exception is the Physical Trait Athletic, which was replaced with Agile to prevent confusion with the Athletics Ability. The Calm Mental Trait was removed, as that is a function of Self-Control; substitute Patient, Disciplined or Determined instead.

#### Converting Advantages

Changing Abilities

Abilities remain largely unchanged — converted characters may choose specializations, as described for Abilities. Certain highly particular Abilities can be converted to *Hobby/ Professional/ Expert* Abilities at the discretion of the Storyteller: *Demolitions* or *Cainite Lore*, for instance.

#### Changing Disciplines

Disciplines are perhaps the most difficult area to convert. Since many Disciplines now have different levels or additional levels, it can be hard to see exactly how a character can come across to the new system.

Characters keep their existing levels of Disciplines, if there are any correspondences. Thus, a character with Intermediate *Presence* still has the powers of *Dread Gaze*, *Entrancement* and *Summon*, though using the new rules. Under this conversion system, the character must buy any missed levels of Disciplines before improving to higher levels of the Discipline. Therefore, the aforementioned character would have to buy *Awe* before learning *Majesty*. Charge the

![](_page_123_Picture_18.jpeg)

![](_page_124_Picture_0.jpeg)

- New Ability Trait One Experience per Ability Trait up to 5. Two Experience per Ability Trait 6-10 (as you learn more, it becomes harder to find things you *don't* know).
- New Background Trait One Experience per Trait with Storyteller approval. Backgrounds may also rise or fall based on roleplaying.
- New Discipline Three Experience Traits for Basic Disciplines, six for Intermediate Disciplines and nine for Advanced Disciplines. Remember to add one Trait to the cost if the Discipline is considered "out of clan" for a character.
- New Humanity/Path Trait Two Experience per Trait (and Storyteller approval).
- New Merit Double the listed cost of the Merit, with Narrator approval. This acquisition should not happen instantaneously; it should be worked into a character's ongoing story. The addition of a Merit should not be treated lightly.
- New Necromancy or Thaumaturgy Ritual Two Experience for a Basic ritual, four for an Intermediate ritual and six for an Advanced ritual.
- New Specialization One Experience Trait in an Ability already known.
- New Virtue Three Experience per Trait, plus the change must be an important part of a character's ongoing story-line somehow.
- New Willpower Three Experience per Trait.
- Buy off Negative Trait Two Experience per Trait.
- Buy off Flaw Double the cost of the Flaw, with Storyteller approval, and worked into the character's ongoing story.

difference in Traits for missed levels — even though Awe is a Basic power, the previous character spent Traits for two Basic and one Intermediate Discipline levels, and thus would have to spend the Traits for another Intermediate power (to gain the otherwise Basic Awe) before moving on to Majesty.

For powers without an easily convertible correspondence like Animalism, a Storyteller may choose to award the character the equivalent levels. A character with the Intermediate level of Animalism (Song of Serenity) would now have Quell the Beast and would keep Beckoning, but would exchange Beast Within for Feral Whispers. Conversely, the Storyteller may set a "wholesale price" of Experience to acquire these new Disciplines, such as requiring the player above to pay a set price of six Experience Traits before making the exchange.

Characters with Advanced Disciplines won't be forced to buy new power levels since they won't be improving (unless they reach elder levels). However, the utility of many of the lower-level powers means that they will often be bought in any case. There's no real need to require players to do so; a character with Advanced *Presence* should not be forced to spend six Traits for *Awe* unless the player wants the power.

Characters with *Necromancy* get the *Sepulchre Path* in exchange for their former levels of power. Similarly, *Thaumaturgy* users take their highest path as their primary path; if any other paths equal this rating, they should be kept but not allowed to improve until the primary path advances.

CHANGING BACKGROUNDS

Influence Backgrounds remain unchanged. The same categories of Influence still exist, with the same levels, so they are no trouble for converted characters.

The various other Backgrounds were not previously used in Laws of the Night, but converting characters now get two Traits to choose among those Backgrounds (except Sabbat, who get none). Characters who lowered generation with Negative Traits get back some of those Traits: since generation used to cost two Negative Traits per step, the character gets a refund of one Trait per step, usable as Bonus Traits. The character's generation should not change as a result, though.

![](_page_124_Picture_19.jpeg)

![](_page_125_Picture_0.jpeg)

CHANGING BLOOD TRAITS

Generation determines a character's total Blood Traits. Don't worry about existing Traits; simply test for blood, as described previously, the next time that the character comes into play. Since all characters now use the adjusted Blood Pools, this conversion should not prove troublesome.

CHANGING WILLDOWER TRAITS

No changes need be made to Willpower Traits, since the generation limits still apply.

Assigning Virtue Traits

Converted characters take the appropriate Virtues for their Morality and assign a number of Virtue Traits equal to twice their Morality Traits. A character with two Humanity Traits would thus have one free Trait in Conscience, Self-Control and Courage, plus four additional Virtue Traits to spend.

Updating flaws and Negative Traits

Most Negative Traits remain the same, though the Negative Social Trait Feral was added.

Flaws, on the other hand, have some changes in Traits, and in some cases a few were removed entirely. The best solution is to use the rules from **Laws of the Night**'s previous editions until such time as the player can pay the difference to remove the Flaw. In the case that a Flaw's Trait value actually increases, simply use those Traits to pay for any other differences in character cost, before adding to the character's pool of Experience Traits with the difference.

CONVERTING MERITS AND FREE TRAITS

Many Merits were removed from the game, or changed in Trait value. As with Flaws, the best solution is to allow the character to pay the difference in (non-doubled) Experience Traits, or to simply use the old rules until the player has the appropriate Traits. A character with a Merit that no longer exists should be allowed to "cash in" the Merit, refunding the Trait value for Experience.

Lastly, spend five Free Traits — under the Free Trait costs, not Experience Trait costs — to finish the conversion.

### CONVERTING CHARACTERS FROM TABLETOD DLAY

Moving a character from tabletop play to live-action can be a little tricky, but it's generally worth the effort. Watching your favorite character blossom into full flower as you take on the role physically is both rewarding and exhilarating.

The new systems in Laws of the Night are designed to mesh more smoothly with Vampire: The Masquerade, so tracking the various Disciplines and Attributes is straightforward.

#### Converting Virtues and Morality

The Virtue Trait system for **Mind's Eye Theatre** runs very close to the tabletop system now, unlike the old Beast Trait system. Virtue Traits convert directly across, with one dot turning into one Trait.

Morality scales are compressed, though, for ease of testing. One Trait of Morality (Humanity or Path) equals two dots of tabletop Morality. Round fractions up, in favor of the character being converted.

#### Converting Tabletop Clans

The clans in the tabletop game do have clan weaknesses, but not clan advantages. Assign the clan advantages normally to the character while converting as a bonus of the system.

![](_page_125_Picture_21.jpeg)

![](_page_126_Picture_0.jpeg)

Attributes in the tabletop game are rated in dots, from one to five. To simulate this rating in live-action play, simply drop the first dot from each one, and then assign an appropriate adjective for each additional dot.

If your character happens to have a score of one or zero in a Trait, you should take a Negative Trait of the appropriate type.

**Example:** *John Slime, the Nosferatu, has a Stamina of 5 dots but an Appearance of 0. When converted, he gets 4 Stamina-related or miscellaneous Physical Traits, but must take a Negative Social Trait. Kurt decides to take the Physical Traits of* Vigorous*,*  Enduring*,* Tough *and* Resilient*, and he assigns the Negative Social Trait* Obnoxious *(in addition to John Slime's existing* Repugnant *x 3 Traits).*

# Converting taBletop aBilities

The Abilities in tabletop play are more extensive, and they tend to have higher levels, than in live-action.

Instead of trying to take levels for every dot in Abilities, look at the highest Abilities on the character sheet. Assign one level to each Ability with three dots, and an additional level to any Ability with four or five dots. If you come up with less than five Abilities, simply take the next highest one and take one level in it.

## Converting taBletop disCiplines and BaCkgrounds

Disciplines and Backgrounds in **Laws of the Night** correspond exactly to the levels in **Vampire: The Masquerade**. Take one level in each of the appropriate Traits for each dot in the tabletop game.

The sole exception is the Influence Background. This Background runs from one to five dots in the tabletop game, but it is subdivided into several categories for live-action play. In **Mind's Eye Theatre** conversions, simply split up any dots of Influence into any desired levels of Influence that total the same amount. If your character has three dots of Influence, you get to spread around three Traits of Influence in live-action play, among whatever categories desired (or all in one).

# Converting Blood traits and willpower

Blood Traits are used exactly the same in both live-action and tabletop play. They convert normally.

Willpower, on the other hand, varies with generation in **Laws of the Night**, but is a static one to 10 dots in **Vampire: The Masquerade**. To deal with this difference, pro-rate the character's Willpower based on her total in tabletop. That is, a 13th-generation character with six dots of Willpower is at 60 percent of maximum Willpower for a tabletop game; the equivalent in live-action would be two Traits.

**Example:***John Slime is a 10th-generation Nosferatu. He has seven dots of Willpower in tabletop play — 70 percent of maximum. In live-action, he would have between two and five Willpower Traits. 70 percent of the way between the two is four, so John Slime has four Willpower Traits.*

# Converting taBletop merits and Flaws

The Merits and Flaws from **Vampire: The Masquerade** have direct correspondences to this material, so conversion isn't a problem. However, make sure that you understand the full text of the live-action version. Often, the change to live-action impacts the game mechanical effects of a given Merit or Flaw.

![](_page_126_Picture_16.jpeg)

![](_page_127_Picture_0.jpeg)

Alyson is looking to join a local troupe for a game of **Masquerade**, and after checking with Brian, the Storyteller, she decides she wishes to play one of the Kindred. Alyson puts on an inspirational CD while the two of them take a copy of the rulebook and sit down to create a character.

step one: ConCept

Alyson begins by looking for a concept, a basic idea which she can build her character around. She decides that she wants to play a tough humanitarian, someone who once was a warrior for a cause but ultimately found that people were more important than slogans, and who now struggles to aid the less fortunate around her. Thinking a little more, she decides her character was a fiery Southern belle who took an active role in the upheaval of the last century and ultimately attracted a vampire's eye with her fierce dedication. Brian likes the concept and approves it: a vampire who actively battles her Beast in order to help others sounds like an excellent roleplaying opportunity. Because she was formerly quite a firebrand, Alyson decides the Brujah clan was the most likely to have embraced her, but that her new views have probably alienated her from her peers — another good story hook for later on. She chooses Caregiver for her Nature (adding interesting depth and departing nicely from the stereotypical Brujah, much to Brian's relief), and picks Survivor for her Demeanor, reflecting the tough facade her character has developed since being on her own. Humanity is the obvious choice for her Morality Path, and Alyson decides the character will be part of the Camarilla as opposed to the inhuman Sabbat. Finally a name for her character comes to her — Daron. Alyson is ready to move on to the next step.

### step two: attriButes

Alyson has to prioritize Daron's Attribute categories now, to determine her basic strengths and weaknesses. She takes Physical as Daron's primary Trait category, Mental as her secondary, and Social as her tertiary. Alyson explains that Daron believes in helping out with her own two hands and learned to take care of herself in her rebel days (Physical), that she has always been good at putting her mind to a task and never backing down (Mental), but that sometimes she is a bit rough with people's feelings and tends to be overly direct at times (Social). Now Alyson must choose individual Traits for each category, beginning with seven Physical Traits. She chooses *Ferocious, Quick, Quick, Enduring, Athletic, Steady* and *Wiry*. That makes Daron someone who's physically dependable and useful in a scrap — a good combination for her chosen calling. Next is Mental, with five traits, and Alyson picks the Traits *Alert, Observant, Disciplined, Determined* and *Clever*, reflecting Daron's strong personality and her awareness of conditions around her. Finally comes Social, with only three Traits. Alyson takes *Intimidating*, *Persuasive* and *Magnetic* — Daron has the makings of a decent leader, but still uses force to get things done from time to time.

### step three: advantages

Now Alyson has to choose Daron's Abilities. Although she sees so many she'd like Daron to have, she begins by choosing some Abilities appropriate to Daron's warrior past: *Brawl, Firearms* and *Dodge*. Then she takes *Empathy* and *Streetwise*, representing what Daron has learned during the time she's spent walking alongside the downtrodden. These choices also give Daron a wide scope of talents, something that appeals to Alyson's notion of her as an independent crusader used to being on her own.

Disciplines come next; here too is another area Alyson wants to have a broad base of powers to call upon, given the complicated nature of Daron's cause. As a

![](_page_127_Picture_9.jpeg)

Camarilla vampire, Daron begins play with three levels of Disciplines, and after looking over the choices available to her, Alyson selects one level of each of the Brujah clan Disciplines: *Alacrity* (Celerity), *Prowess* (Potence), and *Awe* (Presence). She reasons that the first two are a legacy of her more violent days, while Daron has developed the last just recently, when she began working on improving her skills at communicating with others.

Finally, Daron's Camarilla status gives Alyson five levels of Backgrounds to spend. She takes some time on this section — Daron has recently split with her violent past, and that means she probably hasn't had much time to build up resources of her own just yet. To reflect this shift, Alyson chooses one level of *Contacts* (informants who remained loyal to her) and *Street* Influence. Then she asks Brian if she can take three levels of Generation Background, since she needs Storyteller approval before doing so. (This would start her at 10th generation). Getting a better sense of her character's history now, Alyson explains that Daron was the childe of Jonas, a moderately powerful Brujah, who has taken her new change of heart rather badly and now does his best to make her unlife as unpleasant as possible. Her lower generation only makes matters worse, as it increases his shame and the sense that she's flaunting the responsibilities of her blood. Never one to stand in the way of a player making unlife more difficult for her character in an interesting fashion (and knowing a 10th generation character won't upset game balance), Brian gives her permission to take the three levels of Generation, and Alyson is finished this stage.

step Four: Finishing touChes

Alyson must now record Daron's starting Willpower and Blood Traits. Looking at the Generation chart on p. 95, she sees that 10th generation Kindred begin with two Willpower Traits, have a maximum of five Willpower Traits, and also have a maximum of 13 Blood Traits. In addition, as 10th generation, Daron can only spend one Blood Trait per turn, and can only gain up to five levels in one Ability. Looking further, Alyson sees she must perform a Simple Test with Brian to determine how many Blood Traits she begins play with; he shoots scissors, she shoots paper. Curses! Daron will have to begin play with only four Blood Traits, which means she will probably have to hunt sometime during her first session but is otherwise all right.

Next on the list are Virtue Traits; as a follower of Humanity, Daron has the Virtues Courage, Conscience and Self-Control. She starts with one Trait in each category automatically, and has seven extra Traits to spend among her Virtues; Alyson distributes them evenly, spending three Traits on Courage, two on Conscience and two on Self-Control (for a final total of four, three, and three Traits in each, respectively). This allocation represents Daron's level nature and the great determination which she applies to her tasks. Alyson would like to improve Conscience some more, but that will have to wait for later. Averaging her Conscience and Self-Control ratings, she records her starting Morality Traits: 3. Thus, Daron has a 3 rating on the Humanity Path, not bad, but not wonderful either — Alyson reasons that there's still too much of the warrior in Daron, and she'll have to work hard if she wants to raise her Humanity further, which suits Alyson just fine.

Alyson now has the option to choose Flaws and Negative Traits for her character. Her Clan Disadvantage gives her with a *Violent* Negative Trait, which she records at this time, although she receives no additional Traits for it, since it is part of a Clan Disadvantage. Looking over the other Negative Traits, she gains an extra Trait each by choosing *Tactless* and *Impatient* — try as she might, Daron sometimes cuts a little close to the bone with her observations, and she hasn't quite realized yet that real social change doesn't happen overnight. Nothing else seems to suit her in that area, so she looks over

![](_page_128_Picture_6.jpeg)

the Flaws next, finally selecting *Sire's Resentment* (reflecting Jonas's dislike of her) and an *Intolerance: Tremere* at one Trait each. Brian interrupts at this point and asks her to justify such a broad *Intolerance*, and Alyson explains that the coterie she used to run with had a bad run in with a Tremere chantry at one point, and after that she's harbored ill will toward the clan. Elaborating further, she tells of how one of her first meetings among the Kindred was with a Tremere who experimented on derelicts and other lost souls, and how she's held a strong dislike for the clan's scholarly detachment ever since. Impressed and satisfied that it won't disrupt the overall game, Brian permits the Flaw, though he warns her that it may land her in a bit of trouble down the line. Alyson declines to take a derangement or trade in a Morality Trait at this point, and so it's time to spend her Free Traits.

Thanks to the extra Flaws and Negative Traits she's taken, Alyson now has a total of nine Free Traits to spend improving Daron's statistics. Rationalizing that she would have to be plenty tough to survive her past battles and her sire's current ire, Alyson spends three Traits to purchase the Basic Potence Discipline: *Might*, giving Daron an extra physical edge. She also spends a Trait each to purchase an extra Physical Trait: *Vigorous* and a *Brawl: Aikido* Ability specialization, rounding out Daron's already formidable fighting skills. Alyson has four Free Traits left to spend, and she decides to take an extra Social Trait: *Commanding* to represent Daron's ability to organize people for a task. With her final three Free Traits, Alyson purchases the Merit: *Iron Will,* reflecting Daron's fiercely independent nature and also helping to explain how she got out from under her sire's influence with relative ease. Brian takes a look at her sheet, making sure all the numbers add up, and approves it.

step Five: spark oF liFe

All the game mechanics, Traits, powers and skills are now laid out. Alyson has developed a much better image of Daron than when she first started, but there are still some things not covered, things that can't be captured by rules and character sheets; specifically, the details that make Daron live and breathe to the other players. Alyson has to think about ways to convey her character's personality to the other players, to create a host of little identifying quirks that come with roleplaying her. Does Daron wear the rebellious garb of so many Brujah, or does she have her own sense of style? Does she still speak with a Southern accent, or has time erased it? Does she crack her knuckles when she's impatient, or sing softly when she's happy? When she walks, does she display ladylike grace or simply get where she's going as quickly as possible? There are countless subtleties that can be added to make a character seem more real, and which make for an entertaining and memorable personality for everyone in a game to interact with. More character history also can't hurt — Alyson has already gone beyond a stereotypical Brujah to create an intriguing past, but more detail is still possible. Did her mortal family approve of her crusading, or did they disown her for her actions? Where did she first meet Jonas? What specific event caused her to change from a warrior to a protector, and what other friends did she lose when she made that decision? What allies did she make? What goals does she have in this city, and how does she plan to attain them? Does she view the Embrace as a curse, or merely another means to her ends? Exploring all of these questions and more will help Alyson further define Daron and her vampiric existence, but for now Alyson is satisfied with the progress she's made, and she knows that a character is only full realized once play begins. After she and Brian work out the details of her introduction at the next game session, Alyson's all ready to begin, and Daron will soon walk under the looming clouds of the Final Nights.
