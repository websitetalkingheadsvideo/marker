Peter's hurried exit played perfectly into Donata's plans. With a careful breath, she blew out the candles — the ones that she'd secretly replaced after Peter had given her the originals with the explanation about the ritual — and allowed herself a satisfied smile. Running a hand down her dress to smooth the sheer fabric, she straightened, bumping back into Kevin.

"Now that the stuck-up prig of a Ventrue is gone, we can discuss the future," Kevin tried lamely. Donata allowed him to wrap his arms around her waist, leaning back a bit — just enough to be seductive without being blatant.

"Of course," Donata blithely continued as Kevin kissed her neck just below her ear. "He will be a nuisance… one that will have to be taken care of. But, my dear Kevin, when he finishes his visit with the Warlock, he will certainly have made a few more enemies. If you took care of him… well, I'm sure that the nasty little truth about his involvement with the package could come out, and the prince would be inclined to be lenient to you and your friends. Perhaps a few of you might even be given a bit of recognized domain, as a token of appreciation for destroying such a rogue. Of course, with my position in court, I would have to take over Peter's assets… the sizable improvement would certainly raise my position, and we could work together very well indeed." She bared her throat a bit more, alabaster and poised like a statue. All you need is one drink, and you're well on the road to being mine forever, she thought.

Kevin's fangs hovered at her neck, and then he spoke in return. "You don't need to convince me twice. I've been itching to settle things with him! Me and a few of the boys could catch him downtown if you send him to meet us. You take his money, I take his blood… sounds like a fair trade to me."

Before Kevin could think matters through any further, Donata turned in his grasp, tugging him closer with a satisfied smile. "A fair trade indeed. We make a peerless pair," she added, prompting Kevin's ego. The intemperate Brujah needed no further prodding. With a growl, he sank his fangs into Donata's neck, convinced that she would do him no harm. She gasped under the pleasant waves of the Kiss, even as Kevin started down the road to total enthrallment.

Though vampirism is a curse, the blood of Caine grants great mystical powers to those with the insight and dedication to pursue them. Called Disciplines, these supernatural abilities grant a vampire exceptional powers — incredible strength or speed, preternatural senses, the ability to hide from mortal sight or even stranger powers. Fueled by blood and will, these Disciplines are the hallmarks of a true vampire. Brash neonates may command a few moderate abilities, but the most fearsome vampires combine the strength of their Disciplines with hundreds of years of experience and practice.

Each clan possesses a group of Disciplines that are common among its ranks. These "clan Disciplines" can be unearthed and improved with relative ease. The Disciplines of a particular clan are not the sole limits to a vampire's power, though; in theory, any vampire can develop any Discipline. The cost comes in time, effort and boons owed to instructors. Vampires find that Disciplines outside their clan's strengths are more difficult to learn, harder to improve and often inaccessible without the assistance of a skilled teacher who already knows the Discipline in question. As many of the more mystical and unusual Disciplines are considered proprietary to their clans, most vampires do not have the opportunity to learn the truly unique powers; most never have seen or heard of the Disciplines wielded by some of the independent clans and bloodlines.

Among most of the Children of Caine, there are eight relatively common Disciplines: the powers of *Animalism* (the ability to communicate with and master beasts), *Auspex* (heightened sensitivity and supernatural awareness), *Celerity*  (incredible bursts of speed gifted by blood), *Dominate* (the ability to command another's mind), *Fortitude* (supernatural resilience, against even fire and sunlight), *Obfuscate* (clouding of minds, granting disguise and stealth), *Potence* (vampiric strength) and *Presence* (preternatural charisma). The existence of these Disciplines is at least known to all but the rankest fledglings. Certain clans and bloodlines, though, possess their own special Disciplines, including *Chimerstry* (the ability to conjure illusions and dreaming images), *Dementation* (influence over passion and madness), *Necromancy* (control and commerce with the world of the dead and the ghosts therein), *Obtenebration* (the capacity to unleash spiritual darkness), *Protean*  (the power to shift shape and assume animalistic features), *Quietus* (a Discipline of bloody assassination), *Serpentis* (a reptilian and manipulative Discipline from Egyptian lore), *Thaumaturgy* (the rigorous study of blood magic) and *Vicissitude*  (molding and crafting of blood, flesh and bone). The extraordinarily rare bloodlines

![](_page_132_Picture_4.jpeg)

also practice *Melpominee* (manipulation of music and voice), *Obeah* (a power of physical and spiritual healing) and *Thanatosis* (control over the processes of physical death and decay). Some other Disciplines are thought to exist as well, though they and their practitioners are certainly so rare as to be nearly nonexistent.

Most of the Disciplines require the use of blood or some other expenditure of effort. The gifts of Caine do not come lightly or easily, after all. Still, they are invaluable tools for hunting and survival, even in the modern age. Times being what they are, modern vampires must be very careful of the Masquerade with their powers; a mortal tourist with a camera can prove the greatest threat to vampiric secrecy.

Unless otherwise noted, a Discipline is only useful against one target at a time, and the subject must be sensed directly by the vampire — seen, heard or otherwise noticed. Sensory-enhancing powers may allow effects to target subjects at a distance outside the range of normal sight, but technological assistance is not sufficient — the subject must be noted with the vampire's own senses and powers. For example, you cannot use a camera or binoculars to locate a victim, but you can use *Auspex*.

Descriptions of the Disciplines usually refer solely to vampires or Cainites using the powers. Unless specifically noted otherwise, these descriptions include ghouls, revenants and other characters who use the appropriate power.

Some Disciplines require a physical touch or grip to affect a subject. Acquiring this grip requires a Physical Challenge, though an unsuspecting victim may be lured in with a handshake. A subject who voluntarily meets your grip relents, and he is automatically affected; otherwise, you must make the challenge as normal, even if striking from surprise or if you actually touch the other player (which violates the No Touching rule in any case). Touch-activated Disciplines can sometimes be used in conjunction with an unarmed strike, in which case the strike does normal damage and the Discipline takes effect as well if the blow connects.

learning disCiplines

 All vampires can naturally learn their clan Disciplines with nothing more than the expenditure of Experience Traits. As with any other learned capability, the new powers become available at the next game session.

The cardinal eight Disciplines that are shared by every clan — *Animalism*, *Celerity*, *Dominate*, *Fortitude*, *Obfuscate*, *Potence* and *Presence* — require only a willing teacher who is one level above what the student wishes to learn. What payment the teacher requires is best left for the characters to haggle out between themselves. Out of game, the Storyteller may require that the vampire indicate who is teaching him his Discipline

Certain Disciplines are proprietary to their clans — created by them and often practiced solely by them. Some clans have even hunted those outside the clan's bounds who knew of their secrets. Teachers of these wondrous powers are, consequently, few and far between. Those fortunate enough to acquire a teacher, however, are not done yet — in order to study the Discipline, they must drink a Trait of blood from a vampire capable of learning the Discipline (which need not necessarily be the teacher). Cainite scholars believe that this is necessary in order to "attune" the blood to learning something that is quite alien. The drink is only necessary once, and the student may learn as long as the teacher wishes to retain her. Those Disciplines that require this are *Chimerstry*, *Dementation*, *Melpominee*, *Necromancy*, *Obeah*, *Obtenebration*, *Protean*, *Quietus*, *Serpentis*, *Thanatosis*, *Thaumaturgy* and *Vicissitude*. While the *Book of Nod* claims that Caine knew every Discipline, this would seem to be impossible in light of the fact that the Tremere with their *Thaumaturgy*, the Daughters of Cacophony with their *Melpominee*, or the Samedi and *Thanatosis* (to name a few) did not exist when Caine was flourishing in Nod.

For a vampiric predator, mastery over animals is a simple task; the vampire's Beast is more dangerous than any animal's nature. By drawing on this feral connection, vampires can communicate with and control animals. Indeed, vampires who develop a communion with their animal side often seem attractive or at least masterful to most animals.

This Discipline is practiced by the Gangrel, Nosferatu, Ravnos and Tzimisce clans; the Gangrel and Nosferatu often establish equitable or friendly relationships with natural creatures, while the Tzimisce show their mastery over lesser life forms through this power. Ravnos find animals to be useful scouts, spies and meals in their nomadic travels.

Use the *Animal Ken* Ability for retests with the *Animalism* Discipline.

BasiC animalism

#### **Feral Whispers**

By looking into the eyes of an animal and perhaps making some related sound (like growling or hissing), you are capable of communicating with the creature. Your predatory nature allows you to understand and cow natural creatures. Depending on your predilections, you may deal with the animal equitably, or you may demand obedience. The animal may not wish to obey, but this Discipline's power insures that the animal is at least favorably disposed toward you. Even if the animal is intractable, you may be able to force it into submission.

Using this power requires that you look into the eyes of the creature with which you desire to communicate; if this gaze is lost, then you must attempt to re-establish contact if you wish to continue communicating. Most animals will continue to attend your gaze while you are communicating with them, though. Animals without eyes, or very simple in nature, do not have enough of a mind or Beast to connect with easily. This power works best with predatory creatures and larger birds, reptiles and mammals.

You may communicate with animals without any test. However, to issue commands, you must defeat the animal in a Social Challenge — generally, the animal will have the equivalent of six to eight Traits for this challenge, as determined by a Narrator. If you succeed, you can count on the animal following your orders for the remainder of the evening. Most animals lack the intelligence necessary to carry out complex or conditional commands, but they can perform simple tasks like fetching, following people or guarding locations.

#### **Beckoning**

By uttering a howl or other animal noise, you can summon animals to your side. Depending on how you couch your call, you can summon all animals of a particular type within the area, or just a few. The creatures hasten to your *Beckoning*, ready to aid or simply to provide nourishment. Though animals called by this power do not fall under your control automatically, they are at least favorably inclined toward you.

You must expend a Social Trait for each animal that you summon. Only animals that can hear the summons respond; you cannot call a bird from across a city, nor could you call an animal that cannot hear. You may be as specific as you desire within the category of summoned animals. For instance, you may choose to summon all the rats in an area, or just the white ones, or even a specific rat that you know about.

Animals summoned with this power may take some time to arrive. Your Storyteller can issue cards for your animals or swarms, as appropriate. Animals summoned with this power remain as long as they are not attacked or threatened (within their conception — a rat would certainly feel threatened by the movements of several people in the area), or until the scene ends. You can use other *Animalism* powers normally to command or control the animals called.

## **Quell the Beast**

Touching (from surprise or with a Physical Challenge) or gazing into the eyes of a victim, you can project the fearsome predatory aspect of your vampiric nature. Your Beast serves to show your ultimate mastery over your prey, cowing humans and animals alike into submission. Without the inner fire of powerful emotions, the subject is apathetic.

Different vampires evoke this power in different ways. Nosferatu most commonly soothe the Beasts of their subjects, drawing them into lassitude, while Tzimisce and Gangrel often assert their mastery over lesser subjects and terrify the victims into submission. Regardless of the means, the results are similar; any vampire using this Discipline can choose her particular style. No speech or vocalization is necessary — only the physical or eye contact.

You must engage in a Social Challenge with your victim in order to use this power. Once you have intimidated or soothed the subject, he may no longer use Willpower Traits for the remainder of the evening. Such a subject also gains the Negative Traits *Submissive* x 2, for the same duration. Multiple uses of this power are not cumulative; once affected, the victim cannot receive additional *Submissive* Traits through further uses of this Discipline.

Cowing the Beast of a vampire is much more difficult. You must expend a Willpower Trait to make the attempt (before engaging in the Social Challenge). If successful, the vampire suffers from the normal effects of this power. Alternately, you may use this power on a vampire in frenzy, causing the Cainite to snap back into lucidity. In such a case, you expend the Willpower Trait and make the Social Challenge as usual, but if you succeed, the vampire merely returns to lucidity instead of suffering the other effects of this Discipline. You may not use this Discipline on yourself.

# **Subsume the Spirit**

Locking eyes with an animal, you can now move your consciousness into its body, dominating it completely. Your soul pushes aside the animal's weaker spirit, and your own body falls into a comatose state, while your spirit uses the animal as a vessel. Though influenced by the animal's bestial nature, you can still exercise your intellect and even some of your supernatural capabilities.

You are limited by the physical constraints of any animal that you possess — your physical Disciplines do not augment the creature, nor do you have the ability to speak or manipulate objects if that is normally outside of the animal's physical capabilities. However, you can use the animal's natural abilities, such as claws, wings, poison and gills.

There is no functional limit to the distance at which you can exercise this Discipline once you have possessed an animal — you may move freely in the animal's body, even in sunlight (subject to the normal restrictions for remaining awake during the day), without concern for your vampiric form. However, you are not automatically aware of what transpires around your comatose body. If your animal form suffers injury, your vampiric body suffers equal sympathetic injury; if the animal body is slain, your soul returns to your body and you enter torpor. Should you choose to leave the animal's body for your own, this happens regardless of distance as long as you are conscious. However, you must declare this intent at the beginning of the turn and survive until the end of the turn (if you are in combat or other dangerous situations). Fleeing the animal body does not require an action; you may still act normally in the turn that you intend to return to your body. If you are injured (without being knocked unconscious) while attempting to return to your own body, you must make a Simple Test — a tie indicates that you remain in the grip of animalistic behavior for the rest of the scene, and a failure causes you to immediately enter frenzy, though in both cases you return to your Cainite form automatically.

| Subsume the Spirit |  |
|--------------------|--|
| Simple possession  |  |

2 Traits Can use Auspex

1 Trait

3 Traits Can also use Presence and Animalism

4 Traits Can also use Dementation and Dominate

5 Traits Can also use Chimerstry, Necromancy and Thaumaturgy

If your vampiric body dies while you inhabit an animal's form, you can try to remain in the animal body. Each sunrise, you must make a Simple Test (win or tie). If you lose, your spirit plunges into the astral realms, gone forever. Thus, you have only a short time to survive.

Exercising this power requires that you gaze into the eyes of the beast that you intend to possess (if the animal has no eyes, you may not possess it). You must then expend Social Traits to move into the animal's body. The more Social Traits you choose to expend, the more complete your connection to the animal form. With simple possession, you direct the body as you choose; more complete dominance allows you to use some of your own Disciplines while in the body.

Once you have used this power, you suffer from some of the animal's habits and instincts. For each Social Trait expended on the possession, you suffer from one Negative Trait of *Feral*. These Traits remain until you overcome the animal's behavior patterns by expending Willpower Traits — one Willpower Trait for each Negative Trait removed. You should roleplay the animal's mannerisms, even after returning to your own body, until you have managed to remove these Negative Traits, although you can slowly overcome them by spending Willpower Traits over time (you need not try to overcome all of the *Feral* habits at once).

ADVANCED ANIMALISM

#### Drawing Out the Beast

Your mastery over the Beast Within is superb. Through your keen understanding of predatory nature and the ability to influence other creatures, you can draw out your own Beast, pushing your frenzy on others. Animals and ghouls are favored targets for this power, turning them into killing machines, but you can attempt to exert your Beast on anyone.

You must be on the verge of frenzy to use this Discipline. You exert this power in lieu of making any Virtue Test to control your frenzy. Instead, you make a Social Challenge against any individual within your line of sight. Doing so does not cost an action; you may attempt this feat any time that you are about to frenzy. If you win, your frenzy is transferred to the victim. The hapless recipient immediately enters frenzy and even manifests some of your personality, habits and speech patterns (which should be roleplayed — typically, characters with the *Investigation* Ability may recognize your mannerisms in the victim). The victim remains in a normal frenzy, while you are unaffected and unable to frenzy for the duration. Should the victim die while frenzied, though, the screaming Beast immediately returns to you, requiring you to make a Virtue Test or to exercise this power again. If you lose, you instead frenzy immediately with no Virtue Test, and you are unable to fight against your frenzy with Willpower Traits.

While the Beast is loosed in a victim, you remain complacent and placid. However, if the victim leaves your sight before the frenzy is over, you lose your Beast, suffering as if subjected to *Quell the Beast* — you cannot use Willpower Traits and you gain the Negative Traits Submissive x 2. You must find the recipient of your Beast and "convince" the Beast to return by acting in a monstrous fashion, or else kill the victim so that the Beast returns automatically.

A predator's senses must be fearfully acute, so many vampires hone their sensory talents to incredible sharpness. This improved awareness starts merely by expanding physical senses, but as a vampire's powers of perception grow, consciousness itself becomes fleeting and sublime. Such a heightened awareness encompasses subtle textures and emotional states, transcending the physical limitations of the body while developing sharpness of the mind.

The powers of Auspex grant the ability to see through supernatural deception. With such focused attention, Auspex can even pierce the veils of Chimerstry and Obfuscate. Whenever Auspex is active (a conscious choice on the vampire's part), a Mental Challenge may be made with an opponent to try to see through the illusions of Chimerstry or the misdirection of Obfuscate. Winning this challenge with Auspex penetrates the deceptive powers. Losing, though, indicates that the vampire is affected normally. For each level of difference between the subject's Obfuscate or Chimerstry and the searcher's Auspex, there is a Trait modifier on a one-forone basis in the event of ties or overbids. For example, a searching vampire with Telepathy (an intermediate level of Auspex) counts two additional Traits against an opponent who only knows Unseen Presence, a Basic level of Obfuscate. This bonus applies even when not using the full level of these Disciplines; an individual hiding with Mask of a Thousand Faces is still very difficult to detect if his mastery of Obfuscate has reached the Advanced level of Cloak the Gathering. A chance to see through supernatural concealment always exists, but doing so is much more likely if the searcher's Auspex powers are highly advanced and/or the opponent's powers are weak. When using a Heightened Sense, hold up a number of fingers based on your power level (one for Basic, two for Intermediate, three for Advanced).

The Auspex Discipline is most evidenced by the Tremere, Tzimisce and Malkavian clans, who use it for supernatural insights, and by the Toreador, who use their superb senses in conjunction with their artistic work.

Auspex powers retest with the *Investigation* Ability. Willpower may be used for a single retest when attempting to spot an *Obfuscated* or otherwise hidden individual—in such a case, the vampire focuses his senses and concentrates fiercely, redoubling his searching efforts.

#### BASIC AUSDEX

### Heightened Senses

At will, you can extend your senses beyond human norms. Your eyesight and hearing sharpen to twice your mortal limits, while your touch, smell and taste are acute enough to pick out tiny details and features with ease. You can sharpen any or all of your senses, as desired. Furthermore, you sometimes have flashes of insight, preternatural awareness of danger or future events.

Any senses augmented by this Discipline function at twice normal effectiveness, allowing you to spot hidden foes, hear the rustle of leaves outside, taste a bit of poison in vitae, read a hand-written note by touch and smell incense burned hours ago. Should your senses be overwhelmed, though, you may be stunned temporarily. A loud gunshot, a flash of light or other overwhelming factor can incapacitate one of your senses for a time, causing you to lose the benefits of this Discipline. Furthermore you remain completely stunned for one turn, and you lose the sharpened sense in question for the duration of the scene, unless you expend a Willpower Trait to keep your wits about you.

#### Aura Perception

By watching a subject carefully, you can pick out the glowing halo or aura that surrounds all creatures. The interplay of colors in this aura gives you insight into the subject's emotions, motives and true nature. This Discipline is noticeable, though, as you stare at the subject with intense concentration.

![](_page_137_Picture_11.jpeg)

You must be able to see your target in order to use *Aura Perception*. You then spend a turn in concentration and make a Static Mental Challenge with a difficulty of the target's number of Mental Traits (more complex targets are harder to read). Since using this power is a Static Test, the target may not relent or retest. If you succeed, you may ask any one of the following questions, which the subject must answer truthfully: What is your current mood/emotional state? What sort of creature are you (human, vampire, werewolf, etc., subject to your knowledge of such beings and their auras)? Are you under the effects of any form of magic? Have you committed diablerie (see the section on diablerie, p. 216, for how long this form of detection is viable)? Was the last thing you said a lie?

*Aura Perception* also allows you to sense ghosts and astral forms. If you suspect the presence of a ghost in an area, you may expend a Mental Trait to make a normal challenge to sense its aura, as described previously. If you succeed, you are aware of the ghost's aura as a pale, flickering and amorphous light, though this is not sufficient for you to identify specific individual ghosts.

## **The Spirit's Touch**

Every being leaves traces of its thoughts and emotions wherever it goes. With this Discipline, you can read these psychic impressions from objects that others have handled, or that have strong emotional events tied to them. A simple touch and a moment of concentration unlocks a flood of images and sensations, possibly giving insight into the past of the item. Note that you may only use this power on objects or places, not on people, vampires, animals or other living creatures.

By touching an item and expending a Mental Trait for a turn of concentration, you gain a brief flash of insight into any powerfully emotional events surrounding the object in question. Each use of this power on an object allows you to ask a Narrator one of the following questions, requiring a truthful answer: Who last touched this object (before me)? Was this object used in any emotionally stressful events, like a murder, a passionate romance or a maniacal rage? What strong emotions drove a particular subject holding this object? Answers to these questions generally come in the form of images and impressions; you may not get exact names or lists of information, but instead distorted pictures, flashes of sudden passion and repeating sounds and voices. It is up to you to interpret such information.

Using this power on objects charged with particularly powerful emotions — a knife used to kill someone, a blanket clutched during childbirth, a bizarre puzzle that drove someone to insanity — may cause you to be temporarily overcome with emotions that are not your own. At the discretion of a Narrator or Storyteller, you may temporarily suffer from a derangement for the rest of the scene.

# **Telepathy**

Projecting your senses outward, you can pierce the shroud of reason in the minds of others, drawing forth their very thoughts. You can link your consciousness to anyone you can see, sending or receiving concepts that you and the target "hear" in your respective minds.

In order to use *Telepathy*, you must make a Mental Challenge against your subject. A willing subject may relent to this mental contact, but there is no way to identify the originator of a given telepathic missive short of making contact (or you choose to identify yourself). You must also spend a full turn in concentration, focusing on your subject. If you succeed, you establish a brief link, allowing you to send or scan thoughts as long as you maintain the contact. You may issue a stream of thoughts that the subject "hears" as a single concept, or you can pluck a thought from the victim, asking a single question and demanding a truthful answer. Legitimate secrets that

![](_page_138_Picture_10.jpeg)

can be uncovered are anything that could be discerned with *Aura Perception*, as well as such questions as: What is the appearance of a person, place or item about which you are speaking? What is the name of a person, place or item about which you are speaking? What element have you omitted from your answer to a question, if any? What is the true answer to a question that you have lied about? What memories do you have of one topic (querent's choice) of current conversation? If you choose to interrogate an unwilling victim, you must make a Mental Challenge for each question asked; if simply communicating normally, no additional challenges are required.

With effort, you can probe deep into the consciousness of an open mind, drawing out hidden secrets or buried memories. Doing so allows you to ask more detailed questions than the cursory ones usually employed with *Telepathy*. By expending a Mental Trait after establishing a successful telepathic link, you may ask and expect a truthful response to: What is one of your Flaws or Negative Traits, if any (subject's choice)? What is one of your derangements, if any (subject's choice)? Each question asked requires a Static Mental Challenge against the subject's Mental Traits, and the subject may not relent — you are delving deep into the mind, which reacts automatically to defend against intrusion.

At Storyteller discretion,*Telepathy* may discern clumsy uses of *Dominate*, particularly of *Forgetful Mind*, but with a great deal of effort. The most common means of doing so is to establish a link and begin asking questions, as described in the paragraph above. A second Static Mental Challenge against the subject's Mental Traits may allow you to spot gaps in a memory or where a memory has been poorly reconstructed. Modern vampires compare such gaps to be like watching a badly spliced film.

Communication with *Telepathy* proceeds in impulses, images and feelings, and it does not rely on the use of a common language, so even people who do not speak the same language may make themselves understood. Individuals unused to the sudden onslaught of *Telepathy* may be momentarily stunned or disoriented by projected thoughts, at the Narrator's discretion. *Telepathy* may also be used simply to eavesdrop; scanning someone telepathically is invisible and largely undetectable, unless another character with *Telepathy* tries to "listen in" on the link (using a Static Mental Challenge against the scanner). Such eavesdropping can only be used on surface thoughts. Beware, though — if you force your way into someone's mind without permission, the target may make a Willpower Challenge to force you to break off your link.

You may only use your *Telepathy* on one subject at a time, but this limit does not preclude someone else from using her own *Telepathy* on you. If you contact a subject and then use your *Telepathy* on someone else, your link to the first subject collapses and must be re-established later.

Using *Telepathy* on a supernatural creature is a taxing exercise, and it requires the expenditure of a Mental Trait. This Trait is expended before the Mental Challenge is made to establish the link. *Telepathy* only functions on beings with conscious thought. The Discipline has no effect on constructs that are not self-aware or on normal animals.

# **Psychic Projection**

No longer confined to the physical plane, you can project your senses and awareness outside of your own body. Thus untethered, your consciousness roams various planes of thought, allowing you to spy on areas all over the world as an incorporeal spirit. Without the concerns of mass and matter, you easily pass through any physical barrier and move at the speed of thought to any place on Earth, under the orbit of the moon.

While your senses are projected, your body lies in a comatose state, unaware of its surroundings. Your psychic form does not tire from travel, nor is it hindered or injured by the material world. Indeed, you are completely invisible
