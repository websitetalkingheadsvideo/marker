Kindred he catches breaking the Masquerade. If he does not witness it himself, sufficient evidence must be brought forth. This removal costs the keeper nothing.

#### Scourge

- The scourge gains the additional Status Trait: Feared when he attains the position. While he remains scourge, he cannot permanently lose this Trait.
- The scourge can harass, detain or destroy without penalty any Kindred that have been created without permission from the prince, or who have not been presented formally to the prince.
- If the scourge discovers another character harboring or abetting vampires created without the prince's permission or who have not been presented formally, he may remove a permanent Status Trait from that character immediately. This removal costs the scourge nothing, but he must present sufficient evidence of the crime to the prince. Should the prince find the evidence insufficient or be unconvinced of the crime, he may return the stripped Status to the character.
- Not all cities have reinstated the office of scourge, and even those that have do not consider it a noble aspiration, but rather a necessary evil born of the Final Nights.

### Drestation

Prestation is the name the Kindred give for the art of using Status, and technically, it is defined as when one Kindred officially becomes indebted to another vampire for services rendered. In reality, however, prestation is far more complicated a system than that, and its rules are enforced with lethal zeal by its participants.

Players should first make it clear who's doing the favor and who's receiving it. The receiver owes a boon to his bestower which must be categorized as a trivial, minor, major, blood or life boon. The players then agree on either an appropriate number of Status Traits which the receiver then gives the bestower, or they may make other arrangements such as loaning Influence Traits rather than Status. Status Traits given in this fashion are known as Boon Traits. The arrangement must be made amenable to all Kindred involved in the deal, and any other stipulations or clauses carried on the boon must be announced then. Kindred who bestow a boon typically only require one thing: "You may not take any physical action against me for the duration of this boon."

The bestower may continue to use the Boon Traits just as he would any other loaned Status Traits. However, the bestower's loss of Boon Traits is only temporary – they are restored at the beginning of the next story. The primary difference between Boon Traits and other loaned Traits is that the original owner of the Traits may not request their return as usual with such Traits; they may only be returned once the boon has been settled.

The only way for a receiver to rid herself of a boon permanently is to repay or ignore the favor. Breaking boons is a serious insult in Kindred society. Ignoring a favor not only costs the receiver Status, but it also risks the ire of the bestower. Regardless of the standing of the bestower, if the receiver ignores a major, blood or life boon, the receiver always loses Status – nobody likes a vampire who brushes off someone who just went through serious hardship on his behalf.

# GIVING THE DEVIL HIS DUE: REPAYING DRESTATION DEBTS

Getting yourself out of debt is usually an event arranged through roleplaying. Typically, players eliminate boons by returning equivalent favors. However, if the bestower is in sufficient danger, you might pay off your debt by returning only a small favor; indeed, you might even be able to put the original bestower in your debt! It all rests on a sense of timing and a character's skill at bartering. Other Kindred may resent you for doing so, but in crisis a matter of prestation may seem a small price to pay. A favor is as valuable as the Traits associated with it. Thus a minor boon (two Traits) and a major boon (three Traits) are fair compensation for a life boon (five Traits).

![](_page_220_Picture_14.jpeg)

**Trivial boons** are one-time favors, such as protecting someone for the evening, aiding someone with a Discipline or supporting another's political move.

**Minor boons** can last more than one evening, and they usually entail some sort of inconvenience, such as allowing safe passage through a hostile city, revealing crucial information or disposing of a threat.

**Major boons** usually entail a great expenditure of time or resources on the bestower's part. The effects of the favor usually last for many game sessions. An example of such a boon would be teaching the receiver a new Discipline, or purchasing a nightclub to serve as the receiver's haven.

Blood boons occur when the bestower places herself in a potentially life-threatening situation in order to help the receiver. Thus the name "blood boon": The bestower is willing to shed her blood for the receiver.

**Life boons** involve the bestower actively risking her immortal life for the receiver so that the receiver may live.

# CAMARILLA JUSTICE

Justice within the city is typically handled by the prince. Most Kindred justice is harsh and abrupt, as infractions of the Traditions almost always carry a sentence of either death or exile, though some princes may insist that an offender be blood bound to himself and/or the primogen council instead. Only the primogen council can reverse a prince's decision, and it can do so only when they have the political might to back their veto. The primogen council must collectively spend temporary Status Traits equal to the number of permanent Status Traits possessed by the prince to effectively reverse a decision; failure to reach the appropriate amount of Status causes each of the primogen to lose an additional Status Trait.

One of the most important powers of a prince is his ability to call a blood hunt; all the Kindred in a city must aid in tracking down the guilty party and serving the death sentence. Players involved in a blood hunt are reminded not to go overboard while in pursuit; likewise, the player of the character under the blood hunt should realize how heavily the odds are stacked against him and accept the decision with grace.

The only true, across-the-board authorities in the Camarilla are the justicars, mighty Kindred who act as judge, jury and executioner. Elected to a term of 13 years and empowered to enforce Kindred law however they see fit, a justicar's ruling may only be challenged by another justicar. One justicar exists for each of the six Camarilla member clans, and they answer only to the Inner Circle of the Camarilla. A justicar may call a conclave at any time to discuss a problem or handle a matter of justice; all Camarilla vampires in the area are permitted to attend. Kindred sentenced at a conclave may only appeal by requesting an ordeal, which takes the form of an exacting quest executed within a demanding time limit, and failure always results in death.

Justicars typically send representatives, called archons, before arriving themselves. Archons are some of the strongest and most capable Kindred around, and a city hosting an archon is advised to do whatever she asks and do it quickly, as an archon can easily call for others of her kind or even for her justicar. If an archon "disappears" while on assignment, an investigation by powerful Kindred is soon to follow.

# THE SABBAT

#### SABBAT STATUS TRAITS

Status within the Sabbat is useful only within the sect, just as Camarilla Status is only useful within the Camarilla. Status does not function between sects because they despise each other so strongly that any Status the other would possess would have little or no effect on their antagonists. The Traits themselves also differ, because the Sabbat holds different values to be worthy of admiration than the Camarilla does.

![](_page_221_Picture_13.jpeg)

![](_page_222_Picture_0.jpeg)

Troupes should feel free to invent new Status Traits to suit their own stories and the reputations of the characters receiving the Traits.

Vampires who have not yet acquired the Sabbat Status Trait: *Initiated* cannot have or gain any Status until they acquire that Trait.

#### SABBAT STATIONS

Sabbat hierarchy stems from the Regent, the leader of the Sabbat. There is only one Regent at a time, and she is advised by prisci (singular: priscus) and cardinals. Beneath them are archbishops, who control a single city. Within the city, bishops act more or less equivalently to primogen. Paladins/ templars act as bodyguards and enforcers for Sabbat leaders; they are forbidden to join the Black Hand, but are formidable nonetheless. Each pack has a pack leader, who commands and inspires her packmates; a pack priest, who leads rituals and ensures that Sabbat rites are properly observed; and an abbot, who oversees the safety of the communal haven and other day-to-day matters.

#### GAINING AND LOSING SABBAT STATUS

Most Sabbat are fiercely protective of Status accumulated as a result of deeds they've performed, and they tend to take attempts to remove such recognition very badly. Sabbat may remove Traits from fellow pack members by reaching a pack consensus; if the entire pack feels a removal is necessary, then the Trait is simply scratched off. Traits based on past experience such as *Blooded* cannot be removed unless they were achieved by the pack as a whole, but ones based on pack opinion like *Proven* can be removed easily. Status may also be removed by those with more Status Traits and a higher rank within the Sabbat. Superiors should beware of the great loyalty that packs feel toward their leaders; removing Status might cause a pack to recognize their leader's failings, but it just as easily might cause them to mutiny.

Characters may gain Status in identical ways to how it is lost: pack consensus or a decision from higher up. Individual high-ranking characters who wish to award Status must possess at least five permanent Status Traits themselves; packs seeking to praise their comrade must have a group total of at least seven permanent Status Traits. In order for the pack to award Status, each member of the party must spend one Status Trait. For every two Traits spent, the newly elected character may gain one Status Trait, as long as no more than three new Traits are gained in addition to his current Status.

#### SABBAT BITUALS

# Using Rituals in a Game Setting

The Sabbat places great importance on rituals, since they bolster morale and reinforce the doctrines of the sect. Rituals within the Sabbat also serve as tests. Many were created for the sole purpose of testing the strength and endurance of the warriors involved, and the Sabbat respects and encourages this with its many rituals.

#### KINDS OF RITUALS

The rituals of the Sabbat can be divided into three basic groups: the *Auctoritas Ritae*, the *Ignoblis Ritae* and the customs of each particular pack. All Sabbat practice the very traditional *Auctoritas Ritae*. Most packs, depending on their particular pack makeup and goals at the time, practice the *Ignoblis Ritae* in different ways. Each pack also develops its own customs, which often take ritual forms and change with time and battles fought.

#### Auctoritas Ritae

This list of Auctoritas Ritae is, by no means, exhaustive. It merely lists the ones most common to and useful in Laws of the Night games.

#### The Creation Rites

The Vaulderie

Monomacy

Sermons of Caine

War Parties — This ritual occurs when two or more packs go on the warpath to acquire the blood of a Camarilla elder.

Wild Hunt – The Wild Hunt is the Sabbat equivalent of the blood hunt. Archbishops usually call Wild Hunts, but packs have been known to spread the word on their own.

#### Games of Instinct

IGNOBLIS RITAE

These rituals change with each pack that performs them.

Acceptance Rites — Packs use this ritual to accept a new pack leader or priest, or to welcome a new recruit to her new standing as True Sabbat and to award Status Traits on their members.

Initiation Rites

Welcome and Farewell Rites

**Blessings** — This ritual can be used at any time to bless the pack or an individual who has a specific quest. The pack usually receives a Blessing before fights, invading enemy territory or going after a desired object or individual. Blessings often occur during the Vaulderie since blood is required.

Call to Caine

Confession

Ghost Dance

**Jyhad Rites** 

Oaths of Fealty — This rite is incorporated into other Sabbat rites, most commonly the Vaulderie. After passing the chalice around the first time, each individual pauses before drinking from it and promises loyalty to the pack. She then drinks and passes the chalice.

Sacrificial Rites

Pack Creed

Thanksgiving Ritual

Sunrise Service

**Rituals of Justice** — These are rituals the Sabbat isn't supposed to perform without Sabbat officials, but most packs do anyway. Often the pack gathers in two lines, with the accused bound and laid between them; the accused must then answer questions posed by the pack leader or anyone the pack leader permits to speak. The pack will either agree he is guilty and punish him as they see fit, or if they determine that the accused is innocent, the accuser is normally punished in his place.

Using the Ignoblis Ritae

The *Ignoblis Ritae* can be used as often or as little as the players desire, and players should also feel free to create their own rituals for the pack to use. Storytellers may allow Trait gain in the form of temporary bonus Traits to packs who observe certain rituals. For example, a pack that performs a ritual of strength before entering battle might receive an additional Physical Trait for the duration of the anticipated contest. Gift Traits must *always* be Storyteller-approved, and they last only until the end of a specific task. However, use of Gift Traits is an excellent way of encouraging use of the *Ignoblis Ritae*, provided it does not upset play balance.

FUN AND GAMES

Of course, all slaughter of the infidel servants of the Antediluvians and no play makes the Sabbat dull vampires, and it should come as no surprise that the Sabbat have

![](_page_223_Picture_27.jpeg)

invented many ways to "relax" and enjoy their power. The Sabbat typically cause a great deal of mayhem when they decide to have fun, and packs should feel free to come up all manner of creative games that express their pack's sense of humor (or horror).

**Note:** Not all packs enjoy games, and given the frankly inhuman nature of these games, players should *never* be forced to participate if they find it too unsettling out of character. Of course, all the **Mind's Eye Theatre** rules of conduct and safety still apply (more strictly than normal, if anything).

## EXPANDED RULES FOR AUCTORITAS RITAE

#### CREATION RITES

Ritualistic as they are, Storytellers are encouraged to keep the game mechanics to a minimum during the Creation Rites, and focus instead on making the process as vivid and harrowing as possible.

However, for those in need of them, some rules are provided here. The Creation Rites take a minimum of one hour to perform, during which time the characters involved cannot interact with anyone else. The idea is to give characters a sense of having been through a grueling ordeal and appreciate the effort it takes to initiate a member.

One of the Sabbat must knock the prospective member unconscious with a blow to the head; then the would-be Sabbat is Embraced and buried. The pack waits to see if the recruit is strong enough to tear her way out of the earth. At the end of the hour, the potential Sabbat must claw her way out, winning two out of the three Simple Tests against the Storyteller in order to rise from the grave; only one success means the vampire is stuck halfway. The character may make one retest for every Physical Trait she is willing to spend, and successes needed to climb out are cumulative. The other players are not allowed to see the results of the test out of character; either they see a hand emerge, or they begin to wonder what's taking so long.

Packs are advised to have a fresh blood on hand, because newly Embraced Cainites emerge completely bloodless and crazed. They will attack every blood source they see, and they will not stop drinking until they have filled their blood pool to capacity. Until that time, they cannot be the target of Mental or Social Challenges. Furthermore, the Creation Rites give all new Sabbat a temporary derangement of some kind; this derangement typically lasts only a few sessions, although a particularly traumatic experience might cause a more long-lasting illness.

## After the Emergence

Once all strong new Sabbat members have fed, the pack performs the Vaulderie to cement their loyalty. It is usually the duty of a particular vampire's sire to begin instructing the younger Kindred in the ways of Sabbat doctrine, Discipline use, and any other information the neonate might need to know. After becoming Sabbat, there is no returning to her old ways; former blood bonds are broken, and a new, more powerful one has taken their place.

#### Vaulderie and Vinculum

Of all the *Auctoritas Ritae*, the Vaulderie constitutes the most important ritual the Sabbat practices by far. All vampires who share in the Vaulderie are effectively blood bound to each other, but the effects are deeper still than any regular blood bond.

#### Vaulderie Rules

 Find a chalice, cup, bowl or some other physical representation thereof (hats do nicely in a pinch) and dig around for those Blood Traits.

![](_page_224_Picture_14.jpeg)

- Each character present should place between two and four Blood Traits into the chalice. It is the privilege of the pack leader or vampire of highest rank to put in the highest number of Traits, to exceed the number of participants. The pack leader or priest then mixes the Traits around and passes the chalice back around the circle.
- Each individual randomly draws the same number of Traits he or she contributed. The individuals (indicated by some mark on the Blood Trait) on your ritually acquired Blood Traits are those for whom you feel a heightened bond for the duration of the night or until the Vaulderie is performed again.

# **A Clarification of the Heightened Bond**

Sometimes, as a result of the Vaulderie, you wind up with a blood pool consisting of numerous Blood Traits from other characters. In such cases, the predominance of certain character's Blood Traits over others' effectively increases your Vinculum rating to them one notch: Once your Vinculum rating rises to a certain level, you must spend Willpower to even plot against the person. You may *not* harm, betray or fail to defend these individuals intentionally. An agreed Monomacy is the only exception.

Erase the markings on all acquired Blood Traits and replace them with your own. In order to plot against someone for whom the character has a Vinculum rating of 3 or higher, the character must spend one Willpower Trait. In order to plot against someone for whom the character has a Vinculum rating of 6 or over, the character must spend two Willpower Traits.

To attempt the destruction of someone for whom the character has a Vinculum rating at all, the character must burn two Willpower. Without the burned Willpower, the character finds herself realizing the person she hates is loyal to the sect and therefore worthy of respect.

Players should remember that the Vinculum is a full-scale blood bond; this sense of unity is the reason the Sabbat has been so successful, since packs operate without the backstabbing and infighting common to the Camarilla.

# **Monomacy, Punishment and Vinculum**

If you have a Vinculum rating of 6 or higher toward the person whom you want to fight in Monomacy, you must burn one Willpower Trait to initiate the Monomacy contest. Whenever a challenger loses a fight within the rules of Monomacy, regardless of whether or not he burned Willpower initially, he must spend one more Willpower Trait to continue the contest. There is no cost to the defender, since she is obligated to accept the challenge regardless of the Vinculum.

If you are punishing someone in your pack for whom you have a Vinculum rating of 6 or higher and someone in your pack protests, you must engage in a Social Challenge. If you lose, you must burn a Willpower Trait to continue the punishment.

# monomaCy

Sometimes there is no other choice but combat when a disagreement between Sabbat becomes too fierce. As indicated before, most Monomacy contests are battles to Final Death, although any conditions can be agreed on by the participants. As the loser of a Monomacy contest can easily stand to forfeit her soul to diablerie, it is not a process undertaken lightly by even the most warlike Sabbat. Players should keep in mind that, no matter what happens during the "no holds barred" combat of the Monomacy, all the rules of **Mind's Eye Theatre** still apply.

Once Donata had outlined the plan, Kevin had retreated to one of his favorite haunts, an ancient mausoleum not far from the projects. Donata assured him that Peter would be along rapidly, ready to meet his demise.

Feeling uncharacteristically morose, Kevin made his way along the flagstones, rubbing behind the ears of one of his hellhounds. The ghouled dog whined at him, desirous of more of his blood, but it wasn't yet due for another feeding. Still, the powerfully-built hounds had an unmistakable strength and ferocity due to the power of his vampiric vitae. They certainly guarded his territory well.

Atop the mausoleum, Kevin reached into a large nook behind a loose stone in the wall. Carefully, he pulled out a plastic bag, tied shut to keep out water. With a deft movement he opened the bag, rummaging about to remove a guitar. It wasn't his favorite, but when the mood struck him, he'd play in the graveyard, strumming for the hounds and the night. The hounds, in turn, dissuaded the curious from looking about the mausoleum, and kept his few possessions stored there safe for emergencies.

Replacing the bag, Kevin leaned against the wall, sliding down to a comfortable seat. His hands fitted comfortably about the guitar; a few years of undying practice had only improved his once-mediocre skill, and now he could pluck out fair tunes and improvise as the muse came. Thinking again about Donata and how much he wanted to strengthen their partnership, he plucked idly at the strings of the guitar. Melody came as he sought notes to complement her lovely form and personality. Why he'd ever thought of standing against her, he didn't know.…

As Kevin plucked at the guitar strings, something tugged at the strings of his heart.

Ricco, one of the hellhounds, growled for a moment, sniffing at the air. Then, he settled back on his haunches. Kevin looked up, feeling uncomfortable, as if someone watched him from the darkness of the cemetery. Although some Kindred claimed that ghosts haunted the grounds of the dead, Kevin was sure that his little spot was secure. Still, something restless seemed to reach out, on the border of grave and action.

His hand coming down in a strident chord, Kevin's thoughts turned inward, and the puppeteering strings woven about him by Donata's ancient prowess suddenly changed hands.

Relieved of the burden of an unnatural love for Donata, Kevin clashed out a harsh and discordant sound on the guitar. He had some new respect for the woman — she was a consummate manipulator and a powerful elder — but he knew now that she'd turned his own will against him. He'd be more careful in the future — and she wouldn't suspect, if he played his hand properly. A bit of her blood had perhaps turned his mood (and She's turning you into a slave! screamed in part of his mind) but he was still his own man. He'd go along with her plans for now, but they'd serve his ends.

# CHAPTER SIX: STORYTELLING

# are you a storyteller?

That's good, because this chapter is for you! This section details essential knowledges for all Storytellers, such as how to create a story from scratch, how to survive your first game and how to manage an ongoing chronicle. You'll learn the basics of establishing mood, creating believable settings and laying down the law with troublesome players. Experienced Storytellers with a few chronicles under their belts will benefit as well from learning how to integrate new players into an existing game, breathe new life into a faltering story and manage the relationship between the game and the real world. Most importantly, this chapter gives you the straight skinny on Storytelling — who should try it, how it works, why it's hard and why it's the most rewarding challenge **Masquerade** has to offer.

# taking up the mantle

Storytelling is the toughest gig in roleplaying. Paradoxically, it's also the most satisfying. Before you decide to plunge in with both feet, you should be aware of the magnitude of the challenge before you, and consider how you will address it. Many first-time Storytellers become disenchanted because no one told them how difficult the role can become. No one told them how much of their free time being a Storyteller would eat up, how discouraging it can be to hear their players tell them they are bored with their plots or how bothersome it could be to deal with problem players. But no one ever told them how unbelievably fulfilling the role can be. No one told them about the creative thrill of taking a story idea that's floating in their heads and giving it life, watching it entertain, puzzle and challenge their friends, then hearing their players talk about it enthusiastically for weeks or years after it's over.

Realize now that while many players will engage in a game session once a week or once a month, Storytellers usually deal with some aspect of an ongoing chronicle nearly ever day. You may well find the game pervading your life in ways you never imagined. Over-enthusiastic players will call you late at night to talk about the new ritual they want to research. Plot elements will pop into your imagination at the most inconvenient mo-

![](_page_228_Picture_6.jpeg)

ments, demanding to be recorded before they are forgotten. Dinner gets cold while you try to input the latest downtime information into your new spreadsheet software.

Storyteller duties and responsibilities — real and imagined — will devour an incredible share of your free time if you permit them. Even if you excel at balancing your commitments and managing your time wisely, you will find yourself spending a greater period of time on creating and running the game than even some of your more fanatical players. A part of every day will go into the game, even if you are only thinking about it idly while driving to work in the morning. The day of the game session itself will be one of preparing props, answering last-minute questions, approving character sheets and equipment cards, explaining to a player for the 19th time why he can't play his Assamite Methuselah and putting final touches on the plot elements you will introduce. The day after the game session you will be tired, but hopefully satisfied with the night's events.

Being a Storyteller can do some surprising things to your blood pressure. Sometimes nothing will go completely as you expected or planned. Key players won't show up, other players will invite their friends along and ask if it's okay for them to play just for the night, your Narrators will take leave of their senses and make inexplicable rulings that threaten to bring your plot crashing down around your ears, your players will go off on bizarre tangents or ignore crucial clues and you will feel suddenly and painfully ill.

The bad news is that as tiring as all this can sometimes seem, it comes with the territory. The good news is that it's all manageable, and the end product can be all the more worthwhile for it. You can learn to minimize the game's intrusion into your life, to become an expert at coping with the unexpected, to deal with your frustrations without taking them out on anyone, and to reap the very real rewards Storytelling offers. Remember: It's a genuine pleasure to run a game and witness your players' excitement and enjoyment of your creative efforts firsthand. Some players won't be at all aware of the sheer amount of effort you expend on being a good Storyteller, but many will, and they'll appreciate it. They might even thank you for it.

# BUILDING STORIES

Storytelling is less like engineering and more like experimental chemistry. It isn't a matter of adhering to accepted procedures, choosing well-known materials and assembling them according to a precise mathematical equation. It's more like approaching each new project as an experiment that combines familiar and unfamiliar ingredients to create a completely new compound. The results may differ wildly from your original plan, but this won't always be a bad thing. Part of the joy of Storytelling is the fact that each new story is an adventure into uncharted territory, because you simply cannot predict with greater than average accuracy where your efforts will take you. Regardless of the outcome, however, each project — each story — will teach you something you didn't know when you started, and every one will become another experience that will make you a good Storyteller.

Every Storyteller finds her own style when crafting stories. Some are comfortable making thumbnail sketches of a basic plot, rounding up some players and starting to play immediately; others prefer to brood over theme and scope, make extensive plot outlines and spend hours with their players over character creation alone. While it's generally true that you will be rewarded with a smoother game session if you plan and prepare adequately, there is no one "true" way to create and tell stories — you will find your own methods and your own voice when bringing your ideas to life.

Storytellers familiar with Vampire: The Masquerade who now wish to try a live-action game will notice a significant difference between the two types of narration immediately: The materials at hand are markedly different. The story universe of Vampire: The Masquerade is the collective fabrication of the Storyteller and the
