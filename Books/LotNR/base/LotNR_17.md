damage (from bullets, swords, knives, etc.) is intended to kill, and it takes mortals a long time to heal. The Narrator is the final arbiter of what counts as bashing or lethal damage. Characters put below Incapacitated by bashing damage are rendered unconscious for one scene/hour (although the Narrator may rule that they are put in torpor or killed if the beating is fierce enough); mortal creatures pushed past Incapacitated by lethal damage simply die, while vampires enter torpor instead.

Because their corpselike bodies simply don't bruise and break like those of the kine, Cainites *halve* all bashing damage received, round down (minimum one level of damage inflicted).

## Aggravated Wounds

Wounds that are beyond the normal bounds of even the Kindred's unnatural healing powers are called aggravated wounds. Such wounds are usually caused by injury from fire, sunlight or the teeth and claws of a supernatural creature. A Narrator can also deem any other injury to be aggravated, depending on the circumstances. Three Blood Traits, a Willpower Trait and a night of rest are required to heal one level of aggravated damage.

#### Sunlight

Exposure to sunlight is extremely painful for vampires. Indirect sunlight such as through thick curtains or heavy cloud cover causes one automatic aggravated wound per turn of exposure, while direct sunlight causes three automatic levels of aggravated damage per turn. (Heavy clothing may provide some protection, at the Storyteller's discretion.) Vampires confronted by sunlight must also make a Static Courage Challenge or suffer Rötschreck.

#### Fire

Vampires fear and loathe fire, and its slightest touch causes them great agony. Most vampires are extremely uncomfortable around open flame, since it is one of the few things that can destroy them permanently. In game terms, all wounds inflicted by normal or magical fires do aggravated damage to Kindred, and sufficiently large sources of flame will inevitably provoke a *Courage* Test to avoid Rötschreck. A character on fire must win or tie a Simple Test and spend one action dousing the flames.

## Сомват

Combat is the usual intent behind Physical Challenges. Essentially, combat involves two characters in physical conflict. The players agree what the outcome of the challenge will be, each player bids an appropriate Trait and a test is performed to determine the victor. The following section allows for variations on those basic rules, such as situations using surprise or weapons.

The agreed outcome of a Physical Challenge is often the loser being injured. This is not the only possible result, though. The two parties can agree to nearly anything, whether it's tripping an opponent or throwing him out of a window. The results of a combat challenge may also be different for both participants; for example, if a frenzied Malkavian is trying to tear apart a fleeing mortal, the mortal might try to get away from his opponent instead of hurting her.

## Surprise

If a player does not respond within three seconds of the declaration of a Physical Challenge, the character is considered to have been surprised—he is not fully prepared for what's coming. Sometimes a player is busy with another activity or is playing a character who just isn't prepared for the attack. Any player who sneaks around whispering challenges to get the element of surprise is cheating, plain and simple.

Surprise simply means that the outcome of the first challenge in a fight can only harm the surprised defender, not the challenger. For instance, if a player did not respond in time to an attack, but still won the challenge, the challenger would not be injured. Furthermore, if the challenger loses the test, she may call for a second challenge by risking another Trait. After this second challenge, regular challenge rules resume. Overbidding is permitted for both challenger and challenged in surprise situations.

#### Three Step Rule

Anyone in or just entering combat is subject to the "three step rule." You may take up to three steps during any combat action and still attack. Moving one step is considered walking cautiously, two steps is moving directly (down one Trait in Physical Challenges), and three steps is running (also down a Trait in Physical Challenges). A Discipline that allows for an additional action would allow you to take three additional steps, and so on.

## FAIR ESCADE

Fair Escape is a simple rule which allows players to escape from potentially dangerous situations without actually bounding over furniture or diving out of windows. This rule also allows players to avoid combat without going through cumbersome challenges to see if they can "get away."

When you use this rule, you can call "Fair Escape!" any time you see another player approaching with whom you do not wish to interact. Once you call "Fair Escape," you may leave the area without being pursued. There are several guidelines which must be followed when using this rule, however:

- You may not use the Fair Escape rule if the person approaching is nearby (within conversational distance). In such cases, you must initiate a challenge in order to flee. Use common sense in places where there is a great deal of noise and conversational distance is reduced to a minimum (e.g., a crowded nightclub).
- Situations which involve an ambush (all exits blocked or the target is surrounded) or ranged weapons can sometimes negate the use of Fair Escape. Again, use common sense.
- A character using *Unseen Presence* or similar powers may employ a Fair Escape at any time before a challenge has been initiated, unless someone with some form of *Heightened Senses* counters him.
- Characters with supernatural speed such as *Celerity* may gain a Fair Escape by activating their speed before a challenge is initiated. In the case of two characters using supernatural speed, whoever uses the highest level of speed wins (all ties go to the fleeing party). Thus, a character using Basic *Celerity* cannot Fair Escape from a foe using Advanced *Celerity*.

These rules are meant to hasten play, not complicate it. Always try to employ common sense when using Fair Escape. (As a rule of thumb, if it takes several minutes to explain why a Fair Escape would be justified, it probably isn't.)

## Weapons

For obvious reasons, no real weapons are ever allowed in Mind's Eye Theatre games. Even nonfunctional props are forbidden if they can be mistaken for weapons. This system does not use props of any kind, nor are players required (or allowed) to strike one another. Instead, characters should use weapon cards, which display the Traits and pertinent details of a particular weapon.

A weapon gives its wielder extra Traits for combat or other appropriate challenges. Sometimes this advantage is offset by a disadvantage in terms of a Negative Trait. Each weapon has one to six extra Traits that may be used in any challenge in which the weapon is employed. These Traits *cannot* be used as an initial bid. Instead, they add to the user's total when she is comparing Traits. In addition, some weapons have special abilities that may be used, such as causing extra levels of damage or affecting more than one target.

Statistics for weapons are written on cards and carried along with your character card. Weapon cards specify the capacities of each weapon and allow other players to see that you actually possess a weapon. When you have a weapon card in your hand, you are considered to be holding the weapon.

Some weapons have Negative Traits that can be used by the wielder's oppo-

![](_page_201_Picture_16.jpeg)

![](_page_202_Picture_0.jpeg)

## **Concealability**

Each weapon has a concealability rating. If the weapon is not concealable, or if you do not have the proper amount of clothing or cover to conceal it, you must have that card on display at all times. You cannot, for example, pull a broadsword out of your pocket. Instead, you must carry that card in hand at all times or, optionally, you could pin the card to your shirt, indicating that the sword is slung over your shoulder.

## **Availability**

Serious firearms and archaic melee weapons can take some time to locate. Firearms also require permits to obtain, which involves undergoing background checks or waitingperiods in some areas. A character can turn to more "colorful" channels in order to procure equipment, but the black market often means shady dealings and vastly inflated prices. Weapons that have Influence values listed under Availability indicate the level and type of Influence required in order to procure the weapon through illicit channels. Finally, of course, there's cost: A character must have some level of the *Finance* Ability or money-raising Influence to procure exotic melee weapons and nearly all firearms.

Once a character has a weapon, that doesn't mean he can keep it forever. Too often characters run about firing shotguns and large automatic weapons without facing the massive police manhunts that such battles invariably provoke. Take care that characters with powerful weapons understand the equally powerful repercussions that come from their use. These consequences not only preserve game balance, but enforces a sense of realism and keeps the game from turning into *Die Hard* with fangs.

# speCial weapon CapaBilities

Some weapons have special abilities, allowing an attacker to inflict extra damage, ignore certain types of protection or strike multiple opponents. (Such powers are noted under the weapon descriptions.)

## **Armor-Piercing**

Special rounds, generally Teflon-coated, are able to pierce armor with ease. Although they do not inflict extra damage, armor-piercing rounds ignore any defenses from armor. Such rounds are typically tricky to acquire, though, and legal inquiries often follow their use.

## **Destroy Shield**

Although rare in this day and age, certain Inquisitors and anachronistic elders still use shields. A weapon capable of destroying a shield penetrates it automatically and renders it useless after a certain number of blows, no matter what the size or strength of the shield may be.

## **Fully Automatic**

A firearm with this ability is capable of emptying dozens of rounds into a single target at close range. This attack inflicts an extra health level of damage automatically due to sheer volume of fire; however, after emptying the clip from fully automatic fire, the character must spend one action reloading the weapon before it may be fired again.

## **High-Caliber**

Firearms of particularly high caliber can cause crippling wounds with only a few shots. When a high-caliber weapon hits a target, the attacker should make a Simple Test immediately. A win indicates that the target suffers an additional health level of damage from the shot.

## **Incendiary**

![](_page_202_Picture_17.jpeg)

![](_page_203_Picture_0.jpeg)

Mass-Trauma

Certain weapons are so powerful they inflict massive damage on a target, literally tearing away portions of flesh. Such weapons score an extra health level of damage when used appropriately.

#### Speed

Fast weapons can be used to "pre-empt" an opponent's attack, allowing the attacker with the speedier weapon to strike and resolve his challenge first. A character must have the *Melee* Ability to use this special ability, and he must be attacking or otherwise actively using (parrying, disarming) the weapon in order to gain this benefit. Fast weapons only gain a preemptive strike against opponents in hand-to-hand or melee combat.

Since many attacks are handled simultaneously for ease of play (both players testing at once and the winner scoring a hit), this ability is not always very useful. However, if the Storyteller opts to allow each attacker to test individually (attacking striking defender, then defender counter-striking), this ability puts characters with fast weapons on the offensive.

#### Spray

The weapon can strike several targets at once, as noted under the weapon's specific parameters. The shooter makes one test against all the targets simultaneously. Each target who fails the test suffers the weapon's damage, while each target who succeeds avoids the weapon's damage. The shooter risks only the Traits required to test against each member of the group, and he loses only those Traits if any of the defenders wins the test.

## Staking

Staking weapons paralyze vampires when a successful blow penetrates one's heart. The attacker must win or tie two successive Simple Tests in order to successfully stake the vampire.

#### BIDDING WEADON TRAITS

During a normal hand-to-hand fight, characters bid Physical Traits against their opponents' Physical Traits. However, if a character is using firearms, he may use Mental Traits instead. If his opponent is also using a firearm, she bids Mental Traits as well. If the opponent is not using a firearm and is merely trying to dodge, then the attacker uses Mental Traits to attack, while the defender uses her Physical Traits to dodge. This instance is one of the few in which Traits associated with different Attributes may be used against one another.

## Weapon Examples

Melee Weapons

**Knife/Dagger**—These easily concealed weapons are very common, lightning fast in the hands of a skilled user, and they can also be used as ranged weapons if a character uses the *Athletics* Ability properly.

Bonus Traits: 2

Negative Traits: Short

Concealability: Pocket

Damage: One health level

Availability: Any

Special Ability: Speed: In close combat against any weapon that has the Negative Traits: Clumsy, Heavy or Slow, the knife-fighter gains the option to pre-empt the opponent's attacks and strike first in any turn, as long as he has the Melee Ability.

Wooden Stake – A short length of wood sharpened at one end, these humble

![](_page_203_Picture_22.jpeg)

![](_page_204_Picture_0.jpeg)

Bonus Traits: 2 Negative Traits: Short Concealability: Jacket Damage: One health level

Availability: Any

Special Ability: *Staking*: A wooden stake can pierce the heart of a vampire (thus paralyzing the unfortunate Lick) if the wielder wins or ties two successive Simple Tests after striking.

Club/Ax — These two common weapon types can be anything from chair legs to hand axes to billy clubs; one bludgeons while the other cuts, but the essential function is the same.

Bonus Traits: Club: 2, Ax: 3 Negative Traits: Clumsy Concealability: Trenchcoat

Damage: Club – One health level; Ax – Two health levels

Availability: Any

Special Ability: Ax: *Destroy Shield*. Axes render shields useless after three blows. Fencing Blades—Still popular with many elders, these thin blades rely on speed instead of strength, and they inflict most of their damage from piercing rather than slashing.

Bonus Traits: 2

Negative Traits: Fragile Concealability: Trenchcoat Damage: One health level

Availability: Any. A fencing foil tends to attract less police attention than an ornamental saber, especially if the character is wearing or carrying fencing gear

Special Ability: Speed: In close combat against any weapon that has the Negative Traits: Clumsy, Heavy or Slow, the fencer gains the option to pre-empt the opponent's attacks and strike first in any turn, as long as he has the Melee Ability.

Archaic Ranged Weapons

**Longbow** — These huge, powerful bows make mincemeat of regular armor, and many older Cainites are trained in the arts of archery. Modern compound bows are smaller and use pulley systems to generate powerful pull; these bows do not have the Negative Trait: Clumsy, but give the user only five Bonus Traits.

Bonus Traits: 6

Negative Traits: Fragile, Clumsy, Heavy

Concealability: No way. Damage: Two health levels

Availability: Any.

Special Ability: Armor-Piercing: Longbows ignore chain armor. Staking: Arrows may be used to stake a vampire, if the archer wins or ties two Simple Tests after a successful hit. Destroy Shield: One shot from a longbow renders a shield useless.

FIREARMS

**Pistol**—This designation covers nearly any sort of small- and medium-caliber handgun commonly encountered, from zip guns and holdout pieces to 9mms and standard police-issue sidearms.

Bonus Traits: 2 Negative Traits: Loud

![](_page_204_Picture_23.jpeg)

![](_page_205_Picture_0.jpeg)

Concealability: Pocket Damage: Two health levels

Availability: Any, if registered; *Police* 4, *Street* 3 or *Underworld* 2 otherwise.

**Heavy Pistol** — This designation covers the monsters of the handgun range, from the Desert Eagle to a .454 Cassull. These tremendous guns use high-caliber ammunition to punch large holes in their targets.

Bonus Traits: 2 Negative Traits: *Loud* Concealability: Jacket Damage: Two health levels

Availability: Any, if registered; *Police* 4, *Street* 4 or *Underworld* 3 otherwise. Special Ability: *High-Caliber*: Heavy Pistols allow a Simple Test on a successful hit. Success indicates the target takes an extra level of damage.

**Rifle** — Favored by many hunters and snipers.

Bonus Traits: 3 Negative Traits: *Loud* Concealability: None. Damage: Two health levels

Availability: Any, if registered; *Police* 4, *Street* 4 or *Underworld* 3 otherwise. Special Ability: *High-Caliber*: Rifles may be loaded with high-caliber ammuni-

tion. Note that the character must specifically acquire such ammunition to gain this benefit — it is not included automatically when using a rifle.

**Shotgun** — This powerful weapon fires a spray of pellets, making targets easy to hit.

Bonus Traits: 3 Negative Traits: *Loud* Concealability: None Damage: Two health levels

Availability: Any, if registered. *Police* 4, *Street* 4 or *Underworld* 3 otherwise.

Special Ability: *Spray*: A shotgun may affect up to three targets if they are standing immediately next to each other and are further than 20 feet from the person firing the shotgun. This effect can be gained only if the shotgun is loaded with pellets, not slugs. *Mass-Trauma*: A shotgun can cause an extra health level of damage to a single target standing within five feet.

**Submachine Gun** — These weapons are very powerful, and they fire a large number of bullets very quickly, making them the favorite weapons of many gangs, where accuracy isn't as important as hitting a large number of targets at the same time. The law requires these guns be sold as non-automatic weapons, with only single-shot capability, but a use of the *Repair* Ability can convert them to fully automatic fire.

Bonus Traits: 2 Negative Traits: *Loud* Concealability: Jacket Damage: Two health levels

Availability: Any, if registered and non-automatic. *Police* 4, *Street* 4 or *Underworld* 3 otherwise.

Special Ability: *Spray*: A submachine gun may affect up to five targets if they're standing immediately next to each other and are further than 10 feet from the person firing the gun. *Fully Automatic:* A submachine gun inflicts an additional health level of damage if the entire clip is emptied into a target standing no more than five feet away.

Since it stops incoming damage, armor effectively grants a character extra health levels; these health levels are lost before the character himself suffers any damage in combat. Of course, armor does not soak all attacks — a suit of chain-mail does little good for a character whose blood is being boiled by *Thaumaturgy*, for instance.

Different types of armor can absorb different amounts of punishment before losing their effectiveness; it should be noted that armor that has lost all its health levels is not necessarily completely destroyed, but more likely that it has been temporarily rendered useless instead. Of course, some attacks may destroy armor beyond repair. Fixing armor requires the proper tools and a Static Physical Challenge with the *Repair* Ability.

Armor has two different traits for game purposes. Health levels indicate how many levels of damage the armor can absorb before becoming useless and in need of repair. Negative Traits are the drawbacks a wearer gains for donning a particular type of armor.

**Chain-mail —** This category covers most medium levels of metal armor, including scale and brigandine. True chain-mail is quite rare in the modern age, but many elders and some mortal Inquisitors keep a suit on hand.

Health levels: 2

Negative Traits: *Heavy*

Availability: Any. Chain-mail generally must be custom made, and it can cost upward of \$500 or more.

**Plate mail —** Extremely expensive and hard to come by, these ornate suits of interlocking metal plates provide excellent protection but sacrifice a great deal of mobility.

Health levels: 3

Negative Traits: *Heavy, Clumsy*

Availability: Any. Plate mail generally must be custom-ordered, and it can cost upward of \$3000 or more.

**Ballistic vest —** This basic level of protection shields the wearer from some dangers, and it doesn't attract the same kind of attention that more complicated forms of armor are bound to bring.

Health levels: 2

Negative Traits: *Heavy*

Availability: *Police* 4, or *Underworld* 3

**Reinforced (bulletproof) vest —** The favored type of armor for military personnel and law enforcement officers expecting dangerous situations, these vests provide excellent protection, even stopping many types of small arms fire.

Health levels: 3

Negative Traits: *Heavy, Clumsy*

Availability: *Police* 5, or *Underworld* 4

ranged ComBat

Many weapons allow a character to stand at a distance from a target and engage him in combat. In such situations, the character must still go over to the target (after shouting "Bang!" or "Twang!") and engage in a challenge.

If a character has surprised her opponent, even if she loses the first test, she has the option of calling for a second test. Once the second challenge is called, play continues as normal with that new challenge. The target is considered to be surprised for the first attack, and if he has no ranged weapon with which to return fire, he is considered "surprised" for as long as the aggressor can attack him without facing resistance (that is, if he wins on a challenge, she doesn't take damage).

![](_page_206_Picture_23.jpeg)

If the target is aware of the attack before it happens, and he has a ranged weapon of his own, he is not considered to be surprised for the first attack. He may shoot back right away, and challenges are resolved as stated.

After the first shot is fired (and the first challenge is resolved), the target may attempt to return fire (assuming he is armed). The loser of a firefight challenge loses a health level.

Characters using the Athletics Ability to throw projectiles like knives or axes fall under the same rules for regular ranged combat, including cover. Questions of range should not be a problem, but if it becomes an issue use common sense, and don't forget to make allowances for things like the *Potence* Discipline.

COVER

Fighting with ranged weapons allows combatants to stand some distance apart; participants can therefore "dive for cover." When resolving each ranged combat challenge, each combatant can present one Trait of cover to add to his total number of Traits. These cover Traits may not be used for bidding, but they do add to a player's total if Traits are compared. This cover can take the form of whatever obstacles are around and within reach (don't actually dive for them). A Narrator might be required to describe what cover is around, unless the combatants can agree on what cover is available.

If cover is extensive, it may be worth more than one Trait. The number of Traits available for cover is left for challengers to agree on, or for a Narrator to decree. Hiding behind a boulder, for example, might be worth two Traits, while hiding behind a thin wood fence might only count as one. If one combatant goes completely under cover (he cannot be seen at all *and* is thoroughly protected), he is considered impossible to hit. The attacker must change his position to get a clear shot.

#### MELEE AND BRAWLING

Melee fighting can only occur when two parties are within weapon's reach of each other. Characters using melee weapons often have access to special abilities if they also possess the *Melee* Ability. For example, a trained character using a fencing foil can take advantage of his weapon's speed when fighting a character wielding a battle ax.

Brawling can only occur when two characters are within arm's length of each other. Characters engaged in brawling may use unarmed combat techniques on each other, including trips, kicks, punches, wrestling holds and throws. However, regardless of the description, unless the character possesses some supernatural power or other ability that specifically allows for extra damage, all brawling tests result in one health level of bashing damage.

### Specialized Fighting Styles

Buying a specialized fighting style under the *Melee* or *Brawl* Abilities allows you to describe how your character moves to allow retests and permits a certain flair for your attacks and defenses, but does not allow you to do extra damage or specific injuries.

## Two-Gun Mojo

It's possible to use more than one weapon at a time in combat, though it's quite tricky. Just performing a task with the wrong hand is sufficient to penalize your chance of success; compounding matters by doing something else with the other hand doesn't help any.

For the purposes of simplicity, it's usually easiest to assume that a character is the same-handedness as the player, unless the Merit *Ambidextrous* is taken. Furthermore, these rules do not apply to common uses of both hands, such as typing, playing a musical instrument or working a craft.

When performing a task with the off hand, you suffer a two-Trait penalty. Thus, you must bid a total of three Traits to initiate the challenge, and you have a lower chance of success.

The Merit Ambidextrous means that you suffer no penalty for an off-hand, since both of your hands are equally nimble. You still suffer coordination penalties for using both

![](_page_207_Picture_16.jpeg)

hands. Thus, if you're *Ambidextrous*, you can perform a task with either hand without penalty, but if you use both hands at once, you must bid two Traits for each hand.

When you specialize in a fighting style you can choose *Two-Weapon Combat* or *Florentine* for your specialty. This negates one penalty Trait from your attacks with the specified form of combat. Thus, instead of bidding two Traits with your primary hand and three with your off hand, you would bid one and two Traits, respectively. Combined with *Ambidexterous*, you can use two weapons at no penalty whatsoever. Storytellers, take note of combat monsters in the making who try this combination. Developing such a specialty should take *months* of training.

When using both hands, you only get one extra action, regardless of *Celerity*  and similar speed-altering powers. Split your actions equally between your hands — if you have *Legerity* good for two bonus actions and you're using both hands, you get your normal action, your two *Celerity* actions and your extra hand action, for a total of four actions. These would be split up to two actions with each hand; if you took an action or two to do other things, you'd split the remainder evenly. A leftover action is automatically applied to your primary hand.

# Contests oF will

Contests of will are an ancient tradition in Kindred society. They occur when two characters lock eyes for the purpose of intimidating each other; the idea is to force one's rival to back down before a conflict actually comes to blows. Success in a contest of wills is determined in one of two ways. First, it is highly recommended that this action be roleplayed out rather than resort to the rules; in this case, if one of the players relents while roleplaying this action, his opponent is considered to be the winner. If a quick result is needed, or if neither of the players relents, a Social Challenge is used to determine the victor instead, with the loser breaking eye contact and losing the contest.

# Frenzy

When Kindred undergo the Embrace, the Beast within them is loosed forever, causing them to occasionally succumb to a vicious form of madness where they are little more than a wild animal. While in frenzy a character feels no pain and acts on instinct, using his bare hands and fangs to rip apart anything in his path; friends are targets of the vampire's rage just as often as enemies are. What brings on frenzy in a Kindred can be highly personalized, but triggers common to all vampires are blood hunger, extreme passion, frustration, defeat, humiliation at the hands of a rival or threats to a vampire's friends or loved ones. Players must be consistent with what causes a frenzy; a player cannot ignore something that would normally trigger frenzy simply because it isn't expedient for them to frenzy at this time. Discretion is advised; a character in constant frenzy is no fun to be around, and will likely be "put down" by other vampires.

Succumbing to frenzy is considered shameful and debased among the Kindred of the Camarilla, who pride themselves on maintaining their composure and hate being reminded of the Beast within them. Among the vampires of the Sabbat, frenzy is seen as a powerful weapon, and many Sabbat are trained to coax their Beasts to the surface during combat.

To see if a character resists entering frenzy, the player performs a Static *Self-Control* Challenge (*Self-Control* versus a difficulty based on the stimulus, no Traits risked). Failure indicates that a frenzy takes hold. If the vampire succeeds in the test, he manages to push aside his more feral instincts and is immune to further challenges against the same stimulus for the rest of the scene or conflict.

Characters with the *Instinct* Virtue *always* enter frenzy, unless they have more *Instinct* than double the rating of the frenzy shown on the table, in which case they may choose whether or not to enter frenzy. Once in frenzy, the character can

![](_page_208_Picture_10.jpeg)

|        | selF-Control/instinCt diFFiCulties        |
|--------|-------------------------------------------|
| Traits | Stimulus                                  |

| Five   | Outright humiliation; mortal insults      |

make an *Instinct* Virtue Test, if desired, to control her actions for one turn. If she wins the test, she manages to direct her frenzy for the turn, though she will still suffer all the usual conditions of frenzy — resistance to injury, inability to use her Mental or Social powers and so on. If the character loses, her frenzy proceeds as normal. In the event of a tie, the character compares her current *Instinct* Traits to the provocation rating to determine whether she can direct her frenzy.

A character can try to instill frenzy in another character by taunting him and calling for a Social Challenge. If the taunting character wins the challenge, the defender must then test to resist frenzy. If the defender wins the challenge, nothing happens. A successful defender is immune to further taunts from the same character for the remainder of the session.

Once in the state of frenzy, a character attacks all those around him without discretion. A frenzied character does not suffer penalties from wounds until reaching torpor or Final Death. Frenzied characters cannot attempt Social Challenges other than ones related to intimidation, though they need not risk a Trait if someone initiates a Social test against them during this time.

A character may fend off frenzy for 10 minutes by expending one Willpower Trait. However, if the frenzy trigger is still present after that time, the vampire must check for frenzy again immediately. Once in frenzy, a character may expend a Willpower Trait to attempt a Static *Self-Control* Challenge to get a hold of himself. A character also gets a free Static Challenge to end the frenzy once the trigger is removed; otherwise, the frenzy burns out on its own 10 minutes later. If a player attempts to make a test of *Self-Control/ Instinct* and fails, she automatically gains the Negative Social Trait: *Callous* or *Condescending* (your choice), though it can be bought off normally.

Another character may attempt to talk a vampire out of frenzy by winning a Social Challenge against him with a difficulty of 10 minus the target Kindred's Humanity/ Path rating. Remember, the frenzied vampire need not risk a Trait during this Social Challenge. Failing such a challenge usually means the frenzied Kindred turns his attention on his would-be savior.

# rÖtsChreCk

Having already cheated death once, most vampires have no desire to try their luck again. This primal survival urge sometimes manifests as a state of utter terror where the vampire flees the object of his fear any way he can; this state is known as Rötschreck. Both Cainite societies consider Rötschreck extremely shameful, and most vampires avoid it at all costs. The Sabbat executes "cowards" without asking what they fled from, and a Camarilla vampire faces rapid Status loss.

All vampires must battle Rötschreck when faced with exposure to fire, sunlight and the presence of especially powerful faith, but in addition to those fundamental
