duration of the session, except when they enter the kitchen area — designating a reality room provides players with a means of respite from the sometimes-taxing necessity of remaining in character.

Argumentative Players: "You can't do that to my character!"

Do not allow the players to argue with you, particularly when doing so will disrupt the flow of the game. Listen to a player's grievance if it can't wait, then make your ruling and stick to it. Once you make your decision it's final — otherwise you might as well stop making decisions right now. If you respect the input of players who disagree in an appropriate manner, and then make a fair ruling, other players will notice and will emulate this behavior.

Encourage your players to respect the story. If the source of the argument is the death of a player's character, help the player deal with the situation maturely and rationally: Don't allow him to manipulate you through guilt or a tantrum. If the player simply cannot cope with the reality that not all things will go his way in the story, don't allow his social maladjustment to destroy the fun for everyone else. Politely but firmly ask him to leave, and do not allow him to return.

Sometimes players will argue among themselves about the game or their characters. You have the final authority to resolve such disputes. Don't let these situations grow into shouting matches or hysterics: Put a stop to them long before they reach that stage. If the arguing players can't resolve their disagreement, resolve it for them as quickly and fairly as possible; if they can't accept your decision, remove them from the game and try to help them work it out later. You've got a story to run, and you can't let this kind of situation delay the game for everyone else.

STORYTELLER BURNOUT: "I CAN'T THINK OF ANY MORE STORIES."

This game should not take precedence over your life. If you ever find it becoming a burden or unpleasant chore, get some help or arrange to take a break from Storytelling until you feel like returning to the helm. Let someone else take over the story for a while, or try playing a new type of game to recharge your Storytelling batteries. The game should be fun for you as well as for the players. Storytelling should never feel like a completely thankless task, a burden you grudgingly accept because no one else will — if you catch yourself feeling this way, it's vital to give yourself some well-deserved time off before taking up the mantle again.

Player Cheating: "Hey, you didn't have that Discipline a few minutes ago!"

It's an unpleasant fact of life that some players will cheat. A player might try to use Attribute Traits, Disciplines or resources her character doesn't have, or he might try to fudge the amount of Experience he has to spend. Take the alleged cheater aside and try to get to the bottom of the problem immediately — don't let accusations of cheating fester, for they will only undermine your players' confidence in you and their enthusiasm for the game. If you actually catch a player cheating, you really have only two options: Give the player another chance or remove him from the game.

Sometimes players "cheat" on a massive scale, "forgetting" to cross off Blood and Willpower Traits they expend during a game. You can combat these problems by having your carry cards or tokens denoting Blood and/or Willpower Traits. When a character expends either Trait, the player must turn over the appropriate token(s) to you. When a player runs out of tokens, she runs out of those Traits. Tokens can be a very graphic reminder of how precious Blood and Willpower Traits are to characters!

FAILED STORIES: "THIS GAME SUCKS."

Keep an ear to the ground for the murmurs of discontent among your players. None of us are infallible, and you are no exception. Sure, some players seem to never stop complaining, and you'll learn to screen unwarranted gripes. But don't dismiss all complaints as idle whining because sometimes your players will have a genuine beef. Encourage them to bring real problems to your attention, and be appreciative when they offer you constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement.

Sooner or later you'll tell a story that doesn't work right. Maybe the players weren't as interested in the main plot as you'd hoped they would be; maybe you miscalculated the characters' relative power levels and unbalanced the game. Don't let it discourage you from telling future stories! On the contrary, it's important that you learn from these less successful attempts and apply the knowledge you gain to later endeavors. It's sometimes true that failure, as frustrating and disheartening as it may be, teaches us far more than our successes.

favoritism: "You're only letting him play an elder because he's your royerend!"

The best antidote to accusations of favoritism lies in refusing to practice it. Explain your decision-making process to your players and share your criteria with them. Strive to make your decisions about the game as impartial and objective as possible without injuring the story itself. It's particularly important to adjudicate rules situations fairly and not to favor people or characters you particularly like. If you place limitations on certain types of characters or powers in the game, rotate these elements so that players get a fair shot at them.

Unfortunately, no matter how careful you are to remain objective, accusations of favoritism will surface from time to time. Sometimes they are unjustified, masking other issues: A player's character died, and he wants to blame someone for his loss; a player felt she was unfairly denied the opportunity to play a special role in the game; a player thinks the Storyteller's decisions are motivated by friendship rather than the desire to tell a good story. Deal with the accusation directly — take the accuser aside and discuss why she feels that she's the victim of favoritism. Don't overlook the possibility that she might actually be right. Sometimes it's possible to practice favoritism without consciously realizing we're doing so. If the accusation is deserved, amend your behavior accordingly.

Problem Players: "He's ruining the game again!"

Don't ever be afraid to lay down the law with problem players. The integrity of your story is your responsibility, and everyone has equal opportunity to enjoy the story. Most players will usually present no problems, but occasionally someone will cross the boundary of acceptable behavior. Often the transgression is accidental and requires only a reminder to keep players from getting out of hand. But you might encounter a player who actually enjoys getting out of control and wrecking the game through constant disruption. Maybe he likes the attention or the feeling of power it gives him, but whatever his motivation you must deal with him quickly, calmly and decisively. It's your story, and you're well within your rights to remove such offenders from your game permanently.

Once he left Donata's studio, Peter got in his car, drove to the other side of the block, then got out and came back to a restaurant on the near side. He waited for Donata to leave before he set his own plans in motion.

The conniving Toreador certainly had a plan of her own, Peter surmised. She was at the point of becoming more liability than asset. He decided to see if Kevin's unnatural desire couldn't be turned against her in some fashion. He pulled out a cellular phone and alerted one of his minions to arrive with certain preparations.

Finding Kevin wasn't hard. Donata's tip about the mausoleum was right — doubtless because she wanted both of them there. Peter parked outside the cemetery and approached cautiously. He watched the hellhounds closely and called out from a safe distance.

After a moment's silence, Peter's shout was met with an answer. In a blur of motion, the anarch had crossed from the steps of the mausoleum to stand no more than a arm's length away from Peter.

Peter simply put his hands in his pockets and waited for the anarch to get to the point. If Kevin decided to attack him, he could probably fend the Brujah off with a supernatural command, but he needed to see where Kevin's loyalties lay.

Tired of waiting, Kevin continued. "You're here about Donata, right? She's a bit too conniving for her own good. Serve her right if she slipped up a bit in her own plots."

Peter cocked his head. He had no idea how the anarch had broken Donata's preternatural grip, but it had to be a potent power indeed. "You come to the point. She's becoming tiresome. I think perhaps we should pay her a joint visit — let her know where our little alliance stands."

Kevin brushed past Peter, aiming for a motorcycle neatly concealed behind some thick brush. "Oh, I do agree," he said. "Going to hang us out for the sheriff, no doubt. Well, she'd better learn that when she pushes, some people push back."

Peter simply got back into his car, and followed Kevin to the studio.

Donata was still out. Within the studio, the candelabrum waited with a fresh batch of candles. Moving cautiously and with head bowed, the ghoul poured out two glasses of deep red life. Kevin watched the proceedings with a sneer.

"It occurs to me," mused Peter as he offered a glass to Kevin before picking up his own, "that if Kristof really does turn up dead, and the package winds up with Warburton's signature on it, then most of Donata's enemies have vanished. However, if a picture makes it into Warburton's hands — say, of a certain Toreador — then she might well find herself dragged down with him."

"You think I haven't kept tabs on Warburton? My boys can make the necessary… arrangements," Kevin said, as he regarded the glass.

Peter nodded while the replacement candles — from a different Tremere flickered. "To mutual gain," he toasted, raising his glass to Kevin's.

The anarch simply sneered at him, the glasses making a tiny clink like the settling of a piece in a large puzzle of crystal.

# CHAPTER SEVEN: ALLIES AND ANTAGONISTS

There are far more beings than vampires roaming under the dark skies. Some are allies, some are enemies and some defysimple definitions altogether. This chapter presents basic material on the many other supernatural factions of the World of Darkness, as well as some idea of how to present them in a **Masquerade** game.

### ANARCHS

TRUE FREEDOM NEVER DIES

When the fires of the Inquisition roared and elders sacrificed their childer to save themselves, the Anarch Revolt erupted in response, as younger vampires struggled to survive by overcoming the dictates of those above them in station. The largest faction of the rebels eventually became the Sabbat, but not all those involved were interested in joining that fanatical crusade, nor were all of the rest seduced back into the folds of the Camarilla by the peace offers made at the Convention of Thorns. Some, whether due to dedication, pride, fear or sheer idealism, chose to continue the fight outside the boundaries of both sects and the independent clans as well, waging war against those who refused to recognize the rights of vampires beneath them as anything other than pawns. Beset by Camarilla scourges and Sabbat recruiters, however, the numbers of these true anarchs remained fairly low for several centuries, although the flame of their defiance never went out. The new era of democracy born in the 18th and 19th centuries offered them a chance to gain some ground, but the going was still slow against the monolithic Camarilla and the rabid Sabbat.

Things began to change in earnest with the 20th century. As individual rights and freedoms became more important to mortals, an ever-increasing number of new vampires left the confines of sects and tradition to embrace the Anarch Movement. Sensing cracks in the Camarilla's facade, anarch revolutionaries in Los Angeles overthrew the prince and declared the entire city an Anarch Free State. Now, almost the entire West Coast (and a fair portion inland) constitutes the Anarch Free States, bordered by the Sabbat in Mexico and interrupted only by San Francisco, which continues to hold its ground as a Camarilla stronghold.

![](_page_254_Picture_6.jpeg)

The stereotypical anarch is a howling Brujah neonate with numerous body piercings, wearing combat boots and a battered leather jacket, who hurls insults at the elders while torching the prince's azalea bushes and beating his ghouls. Contrary to such perceptions, anarchs can be drawn from any clan or generation, and the only trait most of them have in common is a strong desire to lead their unlives the way they choose, not according to elder dictates.

Player should note that an anarch is not simply any vampire who thumbs her nose at the structures of sect and status, nor is an anarch a leather-clad hooligan who destroys an elder's property. Rather, anarchs — true anarchs — are those Kindred who reject the entire way of unlife offered by the clans and sects, setting aside all the training, benefits, protections and other perks those groups offer in exchange for the freedom (they believe) to choose their own destiny. To be sure, there are anarchs who dress and act like nightmarish rejects from a punk rock show, but this stereotype should be far from the case with even most of the anarchs a Kindred encounters. When playing an anarch, all that is necessary is a desire to resist the Jyhad in all its forms, to face Final Death rather than submit to the rule of those who claim superiority by blood or social standing and the courage to see such resolutions through in the face of terrible opposition.

Anarch characters are created the same as any other vampire character, with the following changes:

- Existing outside of sect and clan, anarchs begin with no Status Traits, not even *Acknowledged*, and they can never gain any in either sect. Furthermore, by rule of the Treaty of Thorns, anarchs need not respect sect Status in any way (and they suffer no game penalty for ignoring it), nor can they be subject to sect justice or automatically hunted on sight without sufficient cause. This restriction does not stop many cities from using anarchs as scapegoats anyway when things go wrong, however. Yet the treaty cuts both ways — Kindred lose no Status for refusing to acknowledge boons owed to anarchs, and they need grant them no favors of hospitality or protection either.
- Many anarchs have Flaws like *Notoriety*, *Enemy, Sire's Resentment*, *Clan Enmity* or other traits relating to a bad reputation in Kindred society or fallout from their decision to join the Anarch Movement. Additionally, Storytellers may disallow anarch characters from taking Kindred Ties Merits such as *Prestigious Sire* or *Reputation* without an excellent explanation.

# ghouls

those who serve

Vampires employ many human servants in their nightly games, but perhaps none are so useful — or dangerous — to Kindred as ghouls. Created when a living being drinks vampire blood, ghouls gain a measure of immortality and supernatural power, but they pay a stiff price for these benefits. Most ghouls are blood bound to their domitors (masters), and they all depend on a steady supply of vitae to keep their special "gifts." Valued for their ability to walk during the daytime and interact with mortals in ways inhuman vampires no longer can, competent and loyal ghouls can earn places of great respect in the eyes of the Kindred. Would-be servitors beware, however. Particularly skilled ghouls are frequently targets of a vampire's enemies (or even other ghouls vying for a master's favor), and when it comes to a question of survival or social advancement, few Kindred have qualms about sacrificing their retainers. Walking such a delicate tightrope without losing all personal identity takes an extremely strong-willed and talented individual, but the rewards of immortality and a generous domitor can be beyond one's wildest dreams.

While the Camarilla makes extensive use of ghouls, the Sabbat does not. The concept of a mortal being given even a fraction of the benefits of vampirism is anathema to that sect. However, occasionally there is no other way to control a particular pawn,

![](_page_255_Picture_9.jpeg)

although such mortals are seldom allowed to enjoy their ghouldom longer than the immediate needs of the sect require. More commonly, if the Sabbat needs to infiltrate human society in a way vampires cannot perform, the sect makes use of select ghoul families known as revenants. Born with vampire blood already in their system, revenants can live hundreds of years, develop Disciplines like regular ghouls and act as spies in places the monstrous Sabbat cannot infiltrate themselves. Most revenants have very low Humanity ratings, and some even choose to follow Paths as do Sabbat vampires. There are four main families of revenants, each with its own special area of aptitude: the freakish Bratoviches, animal trainers and Lupine hunters; the manipulative Grimaldi, masters of politics and blackmail; the reclusive Obertuses, archivists and scholars to the sect; and the hedonistic Zanatosas, debauched seducers of Kindred and kine alike. Revenants are not well-liked within the sect, and only their residual usefulness and the sway of the Tzimisce clan has kept them from being destroyed outright. Revenants in active service to the sect are monitored closely at all times, and those who show signs of failure, willfulness or treachery are destroyed swiftly and without mercy.

More detailed rules and background for playing ghouls and revenants can be found in **Liber des Goules** and **Laws of the Hunt**, but the basics of ghouldom are included here:

- Ghouls do not age as long as they have vampire blood in their systems, and they may also use the Blood Traits of Kindred vitae to heal themselves or boost their Physical Attributes in the same manner as Kindred. Furthermore, a ghoul gains the Discipline of *Prowess*, and he may even develop other Disciplines (*Fortitude*, *Celerity*) over time, although the Experience cost is one Trait more than normal. Ghouls cannot learn any Disciplines without a mentor, and they may not learn non-physical or any Disciplines beyond the Basic level without a domitor of sufficient generation and Storyteller permission. (See **Laws of the Hunt**, p. 90 for an idea of what generation is "sufficient.") The vampire blood in ghouls cannot be used to create blood bonds or be in any way employed against its original owner — as soon as it is ingested, it is considered part of the ghoul in question.
- Ghouls who go without an infusion of vampire blood for more than one month cease to be ghouls (although they may be ghouled again), immediately losing all Disciplines and other blood-related advantages. Such ghouls also begin aging once again, and those who have lived beyond the normal human lifespan may have only days or even hours before time catches up to them; aging unto death is a frightening reality for very long-lived ghouls who find themselves cut off.
- Ghouls typically suffer psychological effects from the blood in their system. Due to their continual need for vitae, almost all are blood bound to their masters, and many develop other obsessions based around their domitor in addition to the bond. Ghouls may also frenzy, although they are two Traits up on all tests to resist doing so, as the urge is due to the vitae in them and not an innate drive. Ghouls may not purchase the Merit: *Unbondable* without Storyteller permission, and even then it costs twice the standard Traits to purchase. (**Note**: Ghouls known to possess the Merit: *Unbondable* are considered pariahs by the Kindred, if not hunted outright, since they do not have the loyalty of the bond and therefore could betray their masters or even hunt them for their blood.)
- Regular infusions of vitae do not affect the aging processes of revenants, of necessity, although they may gain all the benefits of ghouldom (as well as its drawbacks) by ingesting vampire blood. Ghouled revenants may learn *Vicissitude* in addition to regular ghoul Disciplines.

# hunters

### souls who Brave the darkness

Despite the Camarilla's strict enforcement of the Masquerade and the clumsy efforts at secrecy that the Sabbat makes, some mortals inevitably learn of the undead menace that

![](_page_256_Picture_9.jpeg)

walks among them— and some even dare to strike back. A few hunters still operate alone out of ignorance, pride or paranoia, but the Final Nights are seeing many hunters banding together, diverse individuals who find common cause in bringing an end to the undead threat. Younger vampires scoff at the notion that even bands of hunters pose any serious threat to Kindred society as a whole. Elders who remember the Inquisition do not laugh quite so easily. In those nights, vampires were the prey of the fires of the witch-hunters, and the force of humanity united against them was nearly the undoing of all Kindred. Even the cockiest neonate and sturdiest elder must sleep when the sun is high, and who knows what damage even an inexperienced band of mortals can do while their foes lie helpless?

The eldest hunting organization is the Society of Leopold, more commonly called the Inquisition, which dates back to the very first fires of that time. Once entirely Catholic but now open to other faiths, the Society is a branch of the Catholic Church so secret that not even the Pope knows of it, and it is charged with ridding the world of the vampires, demons and their ilk. To this end, these hunters employ a lethal combination of True Faith and martial skill against their enemies. While not all their lore is accurate, they have centuries of experience at battling the Kindred, and their teams are well-equipped and highly dedicated. The current head of the Society, Ingrid Bauer, has reinstated torture as a means of fighting vampires, and while some Inquisitors have qualms about such harsh means, none question the evil the Damned represent. The Society has also opened several secret camps dedicated specifically to training warriors for God, and it is looking to step up the war with undead, perhaps to a level where the Kindred will face the unpleasant prospect of outright war with the Society once more. Any Society member a Cainite encounters will be well-trained in combat techniques, schooled in the means of incapacitating/ destroying a vampire and perhaps possessed of a measure of True Faith as well.

Another threat to vampires lies in the United States government itself. While different agencies seldom share their findings with each other, many individuals within various organizations have glimpsed at least part of the supernatural puzzle. In particular, the FBI has maintained a quiet Special Affairs Division (SAD) dedicated to investigating paranormal phenomena, and the Centers for Disease Control have many documented cases of bizarre blood samples (actually vampire or ghoul vitae) or diseases transmitted without obvious contact between victims (caused by vampires feeding). Most disturbing of all, by making use of new chaoscopic cameras that can detect vampires, ghouls and wraiths, the NSA has discovered the existence of these "black bodies" (so dubbed for their appearance to chaoscopic technology) recently, and it is in the process of training agents to battle the threat they feel such entities represent. The two real hindrances to government action are a lack of information-sharing between agencies, which would fill in crucial gaps in each agency's data; the other is the interpretations that the government agencies give to the data they have. Case in point: the NSA believes that the "black bodies" they see are actually extradimensional entities possessing human bodies toward some nefarious purpose, and it is preparing its eventual retaliation accordingly. In the meantime, the Kindred do their best to plant pawns in sensitive agencies and destroy any evidence that threatens the Masquerade, and all vampires shudder to think what would occur should any of the agencies in question start comparing notes and preparing a more comprehensive national response.

Another, less visible threat to the existence of vampires is the scholarly organization known as the Arcanum. Founded in the 19th century by an elite group of occult scholars, the Arcanum has since spread its Chapter Houses across the world, documenting any supernatural phenomena it comes across and researching all manner of ancient mysteries related to the unseen world. Scientific as it is, the Arcanum takes direct action rarely, preferring to observe instead, although some Arcanists are formidable psychics or hedge wizards in their own right. The arcane resources they have at their fingertips

![](_page_257_Picture_4.jpeg)

are astonishing, however, and while most of the facts are mixed with folklore, some of the knowledge the dedicated can glean is amazingly accurate. Many Tremere would give their fangs to have access to the library resources contained within an Arcanum Chapter House. In recent years especially, the society has screened applicants carefully for signs of ghouldom or other vampiric control. And while the burning of the Boston Chapter House at vampiric hands in 1910 drove many researchers away from observing the Kindred, that incident has only added fuel to the recent calls for the Arcanum to take a more active role in battling the undead or be tacit contributors to genocide. Indeed, some of the Inquisition's latest and most devastating strikes were made on the basis of information passed from Arcanum hands, and that is only the tip of the data at their command. Should these scholars choose to take a truly active role, supernatural beings across the world would discover just how much the Arcanum has seen over the years.

Finally, Kindred have long had their talons in the affairs of organized crime, and many rule criminal families like the elders command the clans. However, vampires in major cities across North America and even parts of Europe have reported a rebellious streak in the local criminal element, from the thugs and hitmen all the way up to the highest leaders. Some criminal gangs have even banded together to hunt their former masters, with results ranging from the amusing to the outright terrifying. Reports gathered from several cities indicate the criminals in question received a visitation by a mysterious being calling him/ herself "Caitiff," who displayed supernatural powers and then convinced them to rise up against their Kindred bosses. Some of these emissaries claimed to be angels out to save the souls of their audience, while others ordered a hunt against vampires in general. Regardless, many criminal organizations have shifted away from undead control as a result. Devastating gang wars have erupted in several instances, and most Kindred commanding of criminal elements now rule from behind a protective screen of middlemen, afraid of where the mysterious rabble-rousers will strike next. A substantial reward has been placed by several different princes for the identity of those responsible (although some vampires suspect a lone metamorph is behind the deception), but the culprit clearly knows Kindred society and has proved a difficult target so far.

This list is far from comprehensive. Other hunting groups form constantly, each with varying amounts of equipment and expertise. When creating hunter antagonists, Storytellers should remember that their learning curve is extremely high. Many do not survive their first few hunts, but those that do become dangerous foes indeed. For more on hunters and playing mortal characters, see **Laws of the Hunt** and **The Laws of the Hunt Players Guide**.

# the Changing Breeds

Vampires are not creatures of the cities simply for the sake of the convenience it offers for feeding. Indeed, many Kindred who travel beyond the protective anonymity offered by the endless skyscrapers never return, brought down by the claws of the ferocious beings known as Lupines. Intensely spiritual creatures and ancestral enemies of the Leeches (as they call them), werewolves apparently serve the will of Gaia, the Earth Mother, and they do battle with the minions of a celestial entity they call "the Wyrm." Anything that threatens to defile nature or upset its delicate balance is a potential target of their great wrath; as manipulators and proponents of the cities, vampires are considered unnatural parasites, a blasphemy on the face of Gaia, and most Lupines will go to great lengths to extinguish any vampires they find regardless of sect or clan. Indeed, werewolves seem to be able to "scent" out most vampires no matter where they may hide themselves, and some Kindred scholars believe that werewolves hunt vampires as part of some monumental religious Jyhad of their own. The only thing that has kept the two sides from an apocalyptic confrontation over the centuries is the reluctance most Lupines exhibit to enter the cities,

![](_page_258_Picture_5.jpeg)

### exChange rates

Sometimes a vampire will want to use a power on a target that calls for the target to spend a type of Trait he doesn't have (such as requiring a Lupine to spend Blood Traits), or enter into an alien mental state (such as putting a mortal in frenzy). The Storyteller's word is final on what powers are allowed across supernatural lines — some powers are designed specifically against a certain supernatural type, and they will not work on another, while others are more flexible. However, if a crossover is needed, here are some general guidelines: If a Discipline calls for a non-Kindred to spend Blood Traits, the target may substitute Gnosis/ Pathos/ Glamour/ etc. Traits instead, or a Willpower Trait if no other Trait applies. Likewise, Kindred subjected to powers that call for them to spend foreign Traits may substitute Blood Traits instead. This rule applies only if the target would normally *spend* Blood Traits, such as the *Blood Rage* Discipline of Thaumaturgy; powers which cause a target damage through drain of Blood Traits still function normally, since the target is not supposed to *use* the blood, only lose it.

If a vampire is using supernatural powers to instill frenzy or Rötschreck into a target that cannot normally enter such states, the Narrator may rule that the target simply suffers from an active *Crimson Rage* or otherwise appropriate derangement for the duration of the power; those states are not as severe as what vampires would normally experience, but they are the closest the target's soul — fundamentally less savage than that of a Cainite — can come to such primal instincts.

as they seem to find the disconnection from nature too uncomfortable. However, as the Final Nights loom closer, more and more the sound of wolves howling chases the setting sun from the sky, and Lupines roam the streets in search of undead prey.

Werewolves appear to be divided by families, and the shifters place a great deal of importance on lineage. Licks who slaughter a lone Lupine carelessly had best beware the wrath of the fallen one's kin. What's worse, like their animal cousins, most werewolves travel in packs, and as such, their numbers and ferocity make even a fairly young pack a potential threat to powerful Kindred. Few hard facts are known of the various Lupine families, although an increasing number of Kindred have faced growing competition over urban centers of influence from a tribe known as the Glass Walkers. These Lupines seem to be adapting to life in the city, and as such, they are deemed a great threat by the elders. Furthermore, Nosferatu are said to have gossip pacts with a family of downtrodden Lupines called the Bone Gnawers, and Tremere have clashed many times with the mysterious, magically adept Uktena tribe. Beyond the cities there are whispers of Lupine tribes even more feral and vicious than that, and of other, rarer shifters too: curious raven-folk, inscrutable cat-people, prankster coyotes and even cunning wererats, the latter who are also said to have a pact with the Nosferatu stretching back centuries. Most Kindred scoff at the notion of such exotic werebeasts — if they have heard of shifters at all — but being walking dead themselves, who are they really to question such anomalies?

Of all the Kindred, only the bestial Gangrel typically have any chance at dealing with Lupines without the encounter dissolving into combat, and relations between the two are still standoffish at best. As long as each side honors the territory of the other, and does not prey on the other's protectorate (a Gangrel who dares to feed on or Embrace a Lupine's relative is still assured a quick Final Death), the Outlanders and the Lupines leave each other in peace. As for the rest of the Kindred, Lupines tend to kill first and ask questions later, an attitude vampires eagerly reciprocate. Some especially diplomatic
